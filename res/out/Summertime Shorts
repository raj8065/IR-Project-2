Mad TwienceEdit[Twilight Sparkle]
I gotta shuffle through these pieces
And try to make it right
My brain is feeling crazy
Another sleepless night
A few more calculations
And I'm gonna crack the co-o-o-ode

When I daydream, I imagine
How fun my life will be
Creating my invention
And working flawlessly
When I finally make it
My heart just might explo-o-o-ode

It's so perfect, can you imagine?
(So P-E-R-F-E-C-T, let me solve this mystery)
So perfect, don't keep me hangin'
(So P-E-R-F-E-C-T, a dream come true, we'll all agree)

I wish it was as easy
As one plus one makes two
The answer's not so simple
Where is this new breakthrough?
This piece of inspiration
I can't wait to downlo-o-o-oad

I can feel it getting closer
It soon will be revealed
I'll spend my waking hours
In this magnetic field
My heart is beating faster
But time is moving slo-o-o-ow

Because it's perfect, can you imagine?
(So P-E-R-F-E-C-T, let me solve this mystery)
So perfect, don't keep me hangin'
(So P-E-R-F-E-C-T, a dream come true, we'll all agree)

Sometimes my thoughts are drifting far away
Gotta pull them back, can't let get them go astray
Here I go, not looking back
Working hard and right on track
It's meant to be, all will see
It fits together perfectly
I got it now, the puzzle's clear
Soon enough, it will appear
I think I'm gonna pinch myself
I can't believe it's finally here!

It's so perfect, can you imagine?
(So P-E-R-F-E-C-T, let me solve this mystery)
So perfect, don't keep me hangin'
(So P-E-R-F-E-C-T, a dream come true, we'll all agree!)

Monday BluesEdit[Sunset Shimmer]
Wake up in the mornin'
And I pull the covers over my head
Hey-oh (Week is starting, week is starting)
I gotta get it movin'
But I'd rather stay here instead
Hey, hey (School is calling, school is calling)

[Twilight Sparkle]
My hair's a disaster, don't know what to do
But I need to move faster to make it through
This crazy morning has got me confused
(Clock is racing, time is wasting
9:00 to 6:00, brain is phasing)

[Sunset Shimmer and Twilight Sparkle]
Everywhere that I go
Everything that I do
I can't shake these Monday blues
'Cause some days, I can't find the way
Out of this haze, hope I'll be okay

[Twilight Sparkle]
Just can't seem to get it right
A cloud is hanging over me
Hey (Rain is falling, rain is falling)
I wish it was the weekend
'Cause you know that's where I'd rather be
Hey, hey (Friday's calling, Friday's calling)

[Sunset Shimmer]
I wonder what things won't go my way
Or if I'll ever make it through the day
I hope this feeling won't lead me astray
(You'll get through it, you can do it
With your gals, there's nothing to it)

[Sunset Shimmer and Twilight Sparkle]
Everywhere that I go
Everything that I do
I can't shake these Monday blues
'Cause some days, I can't find the way
Out of this haze, hope I'll be okay

[Twilight Sparkle]
Just when I feel like it might come crashing down

[Sunset Shimmer]
I can count on my friends to help me turn my mood around!

[Sunset Shimmer and Twilight Sparkle]
(With my gals, there's nothing to it!)

Everywhere that I go
With everything that I do
I'll say goodbye to the Monday blues
'Cause I've got my friends with me
And the sunshine is all I see

Everywhere that I go
With everything that I do
The world feels so fresh and new
'Cause I've got my friends with me
And those blues are ancient history!

Sunset Shimmer: Wow, that's great! I wish I could contribute, but—
Winona: [barks]

Sunset Shimmer: No, I mean, I've changed my mind! Fluttershy, will you help me... choose a pet?
Fluttershy: [gasps] I thought you'd never ask!
Sunset Shimmer: Whoa, there!
[doors open and close]
Fluttershy: Welcome to the animal shelter! Oh, I just know there's gonna be the perfect little pet for you somewhere in here!
[guinea pig squeaks]
Fluttershy: They're just so cuddly. Don't you think, Sunset Shimmer?
[guinea pig squeaks]
Sunset Shimmer: Eh, not for me. Maybe something a little less... furry?
[bubbles]
Fluttershy: How about a betta fish? No fur at all. And this one's got beautiful fins.
Sunset Shimmer: Uh, I don't know. It would be cool to be able to hold my pet.
Fluttershy: Mm-hmm. Ooh, I know just the thing!
[triumphant music builds up]

The Art of FriendshipEditPinkie Pie: I just don't know! There are so many splendiferous things I could paint, but I'm drawing a blank!
Sunset Shimmer: You just need to find some inspiration, that's all. Get those creative juices flowing.
Pinkie Pie: You're absolutely right, Sunset Shimmer!
Pinkie Pie: [slurps]
[pause]
Pinkie Pie: [sighs] Still no ideas. Are you sure that these are the creative juices?
Pinkie Pie: Sunset Shimmer said that all the greatest 
artists find inspiration in nature. Maybe this will help me think of 
something. [sighs]
[pause]
Pinkie Pie: [sighs] Nope.
[birds chirping]
Pinkie Pie: Ooooh! You birdies are right! I have to get even more in tune with nature to really be inspired by it!
[birds chirping]
Pinkie Pie: Chirp! Chirp!
[birds chirping]
Pinkie Pie: [sighs] Pleh!
Pinkie Pie: There's nothing more inspirational than a sweet tune or a bangin' beat! And a one, two, a one-two-three!
[speed drumming]
[cymbals crashing]
[tapping]
[discordant piano chord]
Pinkie Pie: Woo-hoo!
[tapping continues]

Sunset Shimmer: [loudly] So, uh, Pinkie! Any luck finding inspiration?
Pinkie Pie: [stops tapping] What? Oh! No. But I do have a tummy full of fruit juice, feathers in my hair, and a headache! Heh.
Sunset Shimmer: Well, when all else fails, I usually 
just paint a subject that I think is awesome. Something that makes me 
really happy. Like these bright sunflowers.
[whimsical music]
Pinkie Pie: Of course! I've got it! It's been right in front of me all along!
[music]
[paint splattering]
Pinkie Pie: Woooo-hoo-hoo! [giggling] Yeah!
[splash!]
Pinkie Pie: When you said to paint a subject that's 
totally awesome and makes me happy, I thought of something right away! 
Ta-da! I painted you, Sunset!
Sunset Shimmer: Yes, Pinkie. Yes, you did.
Pinkie Pie: Do you like it?
Sunset Shimmer: It's... inspired. Can I paint you next?
[squish]
Sunset Shimmer and Pinkie Pie: [laughing]

 volcano fortress!
Apple Bloom: So what happened to Gummy?
Pinkie Pie: Oh! I went to buy some candy and some more candy, and poof! He was gone! You haven't seen him?

A little bitty smile has the power to start some fun
(Coinky-dink, coinky-dinky-doo-wah!)

It's a zip-zap-toe-tap coinky-dink world
A cling-clang-shake-your-thang coinky-dink world
A wham-pow-wonder-how coinky-dink world
A fizz-pop-never-stop coinky-dink world
Take a whirl in a coinky-dink world

Life has a way of keepin' us all dancing
(Coinky-dink, coinky-dinky-doo-wah!)
Don't skip a beat, just do your thing
(Coinky-dink, coinky-dinky-doo-wah!)
Step on up to all the world has to bring
(Coinky-dink, coinky-dinky-doo-wah!)

It's a zip-zap-toe-tap coinky-dink world
A cling-clang-shake-your-thang coinky-dink world
A wham-pow-wonder-how coinky-dink world
A fizz-pop-never-stop coinky-dink world
Take a whirl in a coinky-dink world

One little thing leads to another
One tiny start never stops
You've got a special magic about ya
Big smile, big mind, big heart!

What do you know? Great minds read at the same time
(Coinky-dink, coinky-dinky-doo-wah!)
What do you say? No way! Me, too!
(Coinky-dink, coinky-dinky-doo-wah!)
Coincidence is a joyride shared with you
(Coinky-dink, coinky-dinky-doo-wah!)

It's a zip-zap-toe-tap coinky-dink world
A cling-clang-shake-your-thang coinky-dink world
A wham-pow-wonder-how coinky-dink world
A fizz-pop-never-stop coinky-dink world
Take a whirl in a coinky-dink world!

Good VibesEdit[Applejack]
The truth that we have come to know
Starts out small, but watch it grow

[Rarity]
Taking time to help each other
Brings us close to one another

[Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy]
Beginning now starts something new
Good deeds done out of the blue

[Pinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle]
Put your kindness to the test
You'll be amazed what happens next

[All]
One small word can brighten the world around you
One big smile can change someone's day
A helping hand goes farther than you can dream
Good vibes, so many different waves

[Sunset Shimmer]
Moments that you don't expect
Spirits down, you're in the depths
The world feels like it's lost the light
But little things can make it right

[Applejack and Fluttershy]
Think of all the lives you've touched
They come 'round and twice as much

[Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie]
Friendship makes the world get lighter
Blur the lines and make it brighter

[All]
One small word can brighten the world around you
One big smile can change someone's day
A helping hand goes farther than you can dream
Good vibes, so many different waves

It only takes a moment to make someone's day
Good vibes, good vibes
It keeps us growing stronger, so let's hear you say
Good vibes, good vibes

One small word can brighten the world around you
One big smile can change someone's day
A helping hand goes farther than you can dream
Good vibes, so many dif-fer-ent waves
