 decided to splurge a little this month and get the deluxe package! 
Let's get a better shot. Whoa! Look at this! Fabulous Fido's Faberge

 paws feel plush! They're encrusted with locally-sourced amethysts. 
Oh... my... goodness! [laughs] This is why I started vlogging in the 
first place! I've been waiting for a sniff like this. It's a classic 
white ankle sock. Cotton/nylon blend, two hundred wears deep, never 
washed. This ain't no dry wick. This baby is as absorbent as they get! 
[sniffs, sighs]
[music stops]
Spike: Huh?
Twilight Sparkle: Spike! Did you spend two hundred dollars on a box with a dirty sock in it?
Spike: [laughs nervously] Can't put a price on... #PuppySelfCare?

Applejack: Our second place team sure knows how to put a game face on durin' a tough competition!
Fluttershy: Couldn't agree more, Applejack! And Tank kept his focus, despite the distraction of being totally in love. Bravo, Tank!
Applejack: Huh. You sure do have the inside scoop, Fluttershy.
Fluttershy: Well, Tank is a very talkative tortoise.
Applejack: And our big winners! I dunno about you, Fluttershy, but I can't think of a more deservin' duo!

Applejack: Everything's not in order! Where's Pinkie Pie?
Fluttershy: Um, isn't Rarity in this class?
Twilight Sparkle: But I thought Sunset Shimmer was in advanced physics with me.
Sandalwood: This is regular physics, dude.
Twilight Sparkle: What?!
Principal Celestia: All final schedule changes must be made by the end of the day.
[door opens]
[girls panicking]
[thud]
Applejack: I was supposed to be in wood shop with Pinkie Pie, not frou-frou paintin' time with nobody.
Fluttershy: I only signed up for drama to be with Rarity, but she wasn't there. Which was very dramatic, but for all the wrong reasons.
Principal Celestia: Don't worry. I'll sort it out.
[keys clacking]
[printer whirring]
Rarity: [sighs] Okay! Phew!
Twilight Sparkle: Yes! Thank you!
Rainbow Dash: All right!
Rarity: [groans] This is the strangest math class I've ever been in.
Zephyr Breeze: That's 'cause it's wood shop. [plays wood flute]
Rainbow Dash: Huh. Sunset should be in here.
Twilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie, have you seen Sunset? Wait. I didn't know you were taking advanced physics.
Pinkie Pie: Advanced physics? [laughs] Thank goodness! I thought they had ruined P.E.! Rainbow Dash, I'm on my way! Don't choose things without me!
Twilight Sparkle: [sighs]
[girls panicking]
Principal Celestia: Girls! I think I can arrange for you all to have one class period together. But this is the final change, okay?

Pinkie Pie: No trouble, space rubble. Stars are like the glitter of the sky!
Twilight Sparkle: I'm so nervous. My favorite

probably very funny. Do you think she'll like me?
Pinkie Pie: Of course she will.
[guests clamoring]

[tires screeching]
Rarity: [gasps] They're shopping without me. [sobs] I've never felt so betrayed in all my life! No!
Sunset Shimmer: We'll see you guys there. I will have plenty of time to think about that.
Fluttershy: [giggling]
Rarity: I guess their plans don't involve me. Driver, take me home!
Taxi Driver: Uh, lady, I need an address.
[taxi stops]
Rarity: I guess I'll just be alone by myself while all my friends are having fun together... withoutâ€”
Rest of Equestria Girls: Surprise! Happy birthday, Rarity!

Shinin' bright, but we're throwin' no shade
Exclusively, we're V.I.P.
'Cause EG's on this yacht

Oh, no!

[Sunset Shimmer]
The sun's beatin' down
AJ fell asleep when no one was around (Pinkie Pie: What?!)
Now she's got a burn and a serious frown

[Applejack]
That won't even stop me from really gettin' down

[Equestria Girls]
Hey!

[Rainbow Dash]
DJ, drop that beat
She knows what we need to make us move our feet
Divin' in the pool to escape the heat

[Rarity]
Now we're getting hungry, and it's time to eat

[Pinkie Pie]
Lobster on a silver platter
'Cause the costs don't even matter
All expenses are paid
EG crew

[Equestria Girls]
Got it made!

[Pinkie Pie]
Little boats are driftin' by
Seagulls up in the sky
We're a picture of perfection
As we wave to them

[Equestria Girls]
Hi!

Hey, hey, hey, hands in the air
Oh, oh, oh, wind in our hair
We're hoppin' on, so float along

Run to Break FreeEdit[birds chirping]
[students chattering]
[locker slams]

[Rainbow Dash]
I have so much more to say
But I live in slow motion
From moment to moment, hey

Holding back from day to day
The clock's ticking slowly
But time cannot hold me down

I find myself in the rhythm of my feet
Feel it in my heartbeat
The time is now, and I won't hold back, hold back

Gonna break free, yeah, I'm runnin'
Watch me, yeah-yeah, I'm runnin'
I let go in this moment, all roads open
Gonna break free, yeah, I'm runnin'
I was born to break free

I choose my path, I choose my dreams
My spirit's a fighter
A passion igniter, yeah

All I need's inside of me
A light shining brighter
A spark to a fire now

I find myself in the rhythm of my feet
Feel it in my heartbeat
The time is now, and I won't hold back, hold back
(Whoa-oh-oh-ohhhh-oh)

Gonna break free, yeah, I'm runnin' (yeah-yeah)
Watch me, yeah-yeah, I'm runnin' (I'm runnin', runnin', whoa)
I let go in this moment, all roads open
Gonna break free, yeah, I'm runnin'
I was born to break free

Camping Must-HavesEditRarity: Hello, internet darlings! It's your music festival muses Rarity and Applejack here, presenting our camping must-haves.
Applejack: Now, you're gonna be out in the hot sun all day long, so be sure to bring plenty of sunscreen.
Rarity: Of course, your SPF won't be complete without a chapeau. And it should match your parasol and your blanket, of course.
Applejack: But you don't really need all that.
Rarity: And maybe a scarf.
Applejack: I can think of two must-haves for makin' an outhouse feel like an in-house. Bring your own TP and plenty of hand sanitizer.
Rarity: Be sure to include one or two all-natural moisturizers. It never hurts to have a whole set.
Applejack: You can't go three days without 'em?
Rarity: Oh, I'll fit them in, darling. I'll just tuck 
them in next to the cushioned seat cover, air-freshening candle set, and
 four-panel privacy screen.
Applejack: [sighs] And finally, you'll need a sleepin' bag for a few hours of shuteye.
Rarity: Plus pillows! Travel pillows, body pillows, accent pillows, throw pillows, bolster pillows, hypoallergenic pillows...
Applejack: And where are you plannin' to put all them pillows?
[scraping sounds]
Rarity: [grunting] Just... [sighs]
Applejack: Excuse me! What happened to bringin' only our must-haves?
Rarity: This is a one-of-a-kind bespoke four-poster bed! I absolutely must have it!
Applejack: Campin's about makin' do with what you got! 
It's about breakin' off a stick to roast marshmallows or rustlin' up 
pine needles for deodorant!
Rarity: But, darling, we're not camping.
Applejack: Huh?
Rarity: We're glamping!
[thuds]
[clunk!]
[fire roaring]
[horn honking]
Applejack: Well. I think I'm gonna like glampin'.
Festival FiltersEdit[chattering]
[click!]
Rarity: Ooh, what filter are you going to use, darling?
Sunset Shimmer: I was thinking about going #NoFilter.
Twilight Sparkle, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Fluttershy: [gasp]
Applejack: Not to sound like Granny Smith, but why do y'all care so much about a filter? All it does is make a new picture look... old.
Rarity: [laughs] Oh, no-no-no-no-no, sweetheart, no. They are so much more. You can model the latest trend with "Shape Chic".
[beeps]
Applejack: I'd never wear a dodecahedron.
[beeps]
Fluttershy: If you're missing your friends, try "Flora/Fauna".
[birds chirping]
Fluttershy: Oh! [giggles]
Rainbow Dash: [laughs] Check it out!

Equestria Girls: [laughing]
How to BackstageEdit[drone whirring]
Sunset Shimmer: Hey, everybody. Sunset Shimmer here, your M.V.P. with a B.T.S. look at the V.I.P. life. Translation â€“ I got a backstage pass!
Sunset Shimmer: Need a break? First perk of the V.I.P. 
treatment â€“ swag, swag, swag, swag, swag! I'm talking foreign chocolate,
 instant cameras, noise-canceling headphones... or... socks. Rock on! 
Must be to keep the bands from getting cold feet. [chuckles] I 
guess I'll just, uh, put them on. [grunts] Whoa. V.I.P. coming through!
[thud]
Sunset Shimmer: Check it out â€“ the world-famous green 
room, where all the bands hang out before the show. Any guesses on who 
we'll see? Are you kidding me? This... is... amazing! You're lookin' at 
the guy who invented pickup-only reverb! Ever wonder who does 
PostCrush's light show? She runs a four-gel hot swap! [screams] This is 
the best day of my life!
Lighting Girl: Did you want to meet the band?
Band Member: Cool socks.
Sunset Shimmer: [laughs] Thanks. Can I get a picture?
[band members laughing]
[camera clicks]
Sunset Shimmer: [squee]
Sunset Shimmer: [narrating] And that's how you backstage.
Festival LooksEditRarity: Some say the best part of a music festival is the music. But to me, it's fashion!
Applejack: An old pair of cowboy boots will keep you from steppin' in a pile of... uh... fashion emergency.
[pig oinks]
Fluttershy: If you've got hang-ups with hangers, look for style right outside your window.
[birds chirping]
Rarity: [gasps] I believe they're famished for fashion.
Fluttershy: Well, actually, they do want me to regurgitate worms into their beaks.
[keys tapping]
Rarity: Innovative! Who's next?
Rainbow Dash: Make sure you can move whether you're dancing at the festival or after a hat trick.
Rarity: Touchdown!
Rainbow Dash: Uh, that's not what it's calledâ€”
Sunset Shimmer: Can't go wrong with a classic.
Pinkie Pie: Classic? You mean like... confetti?
[squeak!]
Pinkie Pie: Confetti everywhere! Hmm. Classic Pinkie Pie.
Rarity: Aah!
Pinkie Pie: Oops! Sorry.
Twilight Sparkle: You know what's always in style? 
Personal responsibility. Earplugs for high-decibel situation, a water 
bottle, flashlight and compass in case you get lost, the other kind of 
compass in case you needâ€”
Rarity: And there you have it, my loves. At the end of 
the day, it's always in fashion to be utterly yourselves. See you at the
 festival!
Five Lines You Need to Stand InEdit[indistinct chattering]
[drone whirring]
Pinkie Pie: Hello, computer net friends. Pinkie Pie 
here, bringing you the list you've all been waiting for. Because anybody
 who's anybody knows that music festivals aren't about the music or the 
scene or even the camping. Which is why we're counting down the five 
lines you need to stand in! Oh, yeah!
Pinkie Pie: First up, the security line. If we play this right, we might just make a new friend.
Security Guard: Bag, please.
Pinkie Pie: You can show off all the cool stuff in your purse.
Security Guard: How in theâ€”?
Pinkie Pie: I know, right?
Pinkie Pie: The only thing that tastes better than nachos
 is nachos you waited two hours to get. Besides, how else could I ever 
decide what I want on them? Which is everything! Ohhhh, delicious! 
[eating noisily]
Pinkie Pie: Up next, the photo booth line. Let's practice a pose! Say "cheese"! Say, cheese?
"Watermelody": [gags]
Pinkie Pie: Eh, your loss. [eating noisily]
Pinkie Pie: Why not take a chance on a mystery line? It could lead to the coolest place you've ever seen! [to person in line] Do you know where this line goes?
Person in Line: ["I-don't-know" sound]
Pinkie Pie: Ah! Me, neither! But if it's this long, it's got to be good, right? [giggles]
Pinkie Pie: Last, but certainly not least, is the bathroom line. Or, as I like to call it, the conga line! Cha-cha-cha, everybody!
[students laughing]
[conga music]
Pinkie Pie: This is the best line ever!
[door opens]
Pinkie Pie: Congratulations! You made it!
Find the MagicEdit[The Dazzlings]
Where do we go? Every day's the same
Did we lose the magic, magic, magic?
So ordinary, stuck on repeat
Gotta find the passion, passion, passion

The days go round and round, round and round
Gotta break away, find a great escape
Round and round and round
Round and round and round
Ohhh

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, let's find
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, let's find
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, let's find the magic

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, let's find
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, let's find
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, let's find the magic

[Adagio Dazzle]
Can I find the beauty in the simple things?

[The Dazzlings]
Can I learn to see it, see it, see it?

The days go round and round, round and round
Gotta break away, find a great escape
Round and round and round
Round and round and round
Ohhh

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, let's find
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, let's find
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, let's find the magic

[Adagio Dazzle]
Let's find the magic

[The Dazzlings]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, let's find

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, let's find the magic

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Let It RainEdit[Sunset Shimmer]
It's all right, yeah
I'm walking right beside you
I feel the way, feel the way that you do, too
Oh, I can't lie, sometimes

Everything feels like it's just too much
But you gotta let it in, even if it's tough
Know it gets better, know it gets better
Push through the weather, weather

Let it ra-a-a-ain
Let it ra-a-a-ain
Don't be afraid of walls coming down
Sometimes it hurts, you'll figure it out
Let it ra-a-a-ain

Let it rain, it's okay
There's beauty in the breakdown
There's sun behind those gray clouds
You know, I can't lie, it's all right

Everything feels like it's just too much
But you gotta let it in, even if it's tough
Know it gets better, know it gets better
We push through the weather, weather

Let it ra-a-a-ain
(There's beauty, there's beauty in the breakdown)
Let it ra-a-a-ain
Don't be afraid of walls coming down
Sometimes it hurts, you'll figure it out
Let it ra-a-a-ain
(There's beauty, there's beauty in the breakdown)

Let it rain, let it ra-a-a-ain...
