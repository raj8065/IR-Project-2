The Science of MagicEditThe Rainbooms: [conversing] Huh?
Rainbow Dash: Uh, I thought we were rehearsing.
Sunset Shimmer: Well, you are. Sort of. Back when I was 
Princess Celestia's student, I learned best by going out into the field 
and actually doing something. Studying ancient books is fine for some 
people, but I like to solve magical mysteries by rolling up my sleeves 
and getting my hooves... uh, hands dirty.
[glove snaps]
Applejack: I can relate to workin' hard outdoors, but what the hay does that have to do with us playin' music?
Sunset Shimmer: I'm trying to figure out how magic works
 here. Why you grow ears, tails, and wings when you pony up and what 
your instruments have to do with it.
Fluttershy: Um, are you sure we need to figure it out?
Sunset Shimmer: It'll be fun. Just start playing. You won't even know I'm here.
[Background singers]
Bah, bah, bah-da, bah, bah, bup, bah
Bah, bah, bah-da, bah
Bah, bah, bah-da, bah, bah, bup, bah

Applejack: [chomps apple]
[Background singers]
Bah, bah, bah-da, bah, bah, bup, bah
Bah, bah, bah-da, bah
Bah, bah, bah-da, bah, bah, bup, bah
Bah, bah, bah-da, bah
Bah, bah, bah-da, bah

[drum solo]
[Background singers]
Bah, bah, bah-da, bah, bah, bup, bah
Bah, bah, bah-da, bah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[electricity crackle]
Sunset Shimmer: Finally, after all this testing, I've 
come to a definitive conclusion! [electricity crackles] [coughs] I have 
no idea how magic works in this world. [groans]
Pinkie SpyEdit[whistle blows]
Rainbow Dash: Crystal Prep High School. The competition!
[rustling]
Pinkie Pie: Hey, Rainbow!
Rainbow Dash: Gah! What are you doing?
Pinkie Pie: You said we needed to be sneaky while we 
check out the competition for the Friendship Games. Wanna see what else I
 have? Cat burglar! Dog burglar! Tree! Bunny suit! Camouflage!
Rainbow Dash: That's, like, the opposite of camouflage! Quick! Get down!
[whistle blowing faintly]
Rainbow Dash: We need to get a better view!
[balloons inflating]
Pinkie Pie: Best view in the house!
[whistle blows]
[balloons popping]
[whistle blows]
[balloon deflates]
Pinkie Pie: [sniffing] You smell like vanilla.
Rainbow Dash: We're trying to eavesdrop! That means they don't hear us!
Pinkie Pie: Ooh! I have just the thing!
"Said Thunderbolt": [panting]
Rainbow Dash: What are you doing?! We're trying to spy 
on them! Do you even know what the word "spy" means? It means being 
sneaky! It means not being seen! It means BEING QUIET!
[pause]
Pinkie Pie: Bush to Dash. Code red. You have been spotted. RUUUUUUUUUUUNNN!
All's Fair in Love & Friendship GamesEdit[bell rings]

Lyra Heartstrings: "It tastes like marshmallows"?

Sweetie Drops: [gasps] You know me so well!
Lyra Heartstrings: [scoffs] You know me so well!
Sandalwood: Dudes, the tryouts for the Friendship Games are about to start!

Photo FinishedEditVice Principal Luna: Photo Finish, our yearbook photos this year could use a bit more... mmm, pizzazz. Would you like to take some pictures for—
Photo Finish: Say no more! I, Photo Finish, will kepture za magicks! I go!
Photo Finish: Shtop! Hold that pose! [snaps fingers] Ja! You are shtarving! Now take a bite! No! Do not bite it! Yes! Yes! No. No!
[camera snapping]
Photo Finish: Enough! I go!
[basketball bouncing]
Photo Finish: Shports! [snaps fingers]
[fan whirring]
Photo Finish: Jump! Jump! Like a beautiful gresshopper! 
Like a graceful gazelle! You are striving to place the orb of desire in 
the net of the future!
[camera snapping]
Photo Finish: Enough! I go!
[crash!]
Photo Finish: Yes! Read! You are so very intrigued by the
 story! No, no! That book is out of order! It does not comply vith the 
Dewey Decimal System!
Miss Cheerilee: Shhhh!
Photo Finish: Enough! I go!
Photo Finish: Drink! Drink! Play, play! Paint it! Paint it! Yes! No! Yes! No! Enough! I go!
Vice Principal Luna: Photo Finish, I have been receiving a
 number of complaints from students and faculty about you! Do you have 
anything to say for yourself?
Photo Finish: I say nothink. Photo Finish lets her work speak for itself.
Vice Principal Luna: These are really impressive! You may continue, but do try to be less disruptive.
Photo Finish: Hold that pose! Ja, ja! You have the authority! Sign the waiver! [indistinct]
Vice Principal Luna: Hold on! What the—?! [screams]
A Banner DayEditVice Principal Luna: I'm sure you'll come up with the 
perfect sign that lets the Crystal Prep kids feel welcome but also 
conveys that we are stiff competition.
Micro Chips: 100 percent!
Flash Sentry: Oh, yeah, sure!
Sandalwood: Totally.
Vice Principal Luna: I'll be back in an hour to see what you've come up with.
Flash Sentry: I got it! We should decorate it with the 
sheet music to my song "Love in a Flash". It'll show them we're talented
 while welcoming them in with the universal language of music.
Micro Chips: I was thinking we could paint a model of DNA. It shows that we're smart but invites them in with the very fiber of our being.
Sandalwood: But what we should do is portray peace through art. One love, bros.
[clattering]
[guitar music]
[techno music]
[new-age music]
Sandalwood: Dude!
Micro Chips: [gasps] What did you do?!
Flash Sentry: Watch the hair, man!
[thud]
[clank]
Sandalwood: You're harshing the flow!
Micro Chips: Hey, you did that on purpose! [gasps] My friendship algorithm!
Flash Sentry: Hey! You just projectile-scienced all over my chorus!
Micro Chips: Well, you guys painted all over my molecular structures!
Sandalwood: And how am I supposed to paint my spirit guide when there's DNA and a treble clef in the way?
Flash Sentry: Oh, I don't know! Ask your spirit guide!
All: You're ruining my design!
Vice Principal Luna: [clears throat] My, oh, my.
Micro Chips: We're really—
Vice Principal Luna: Proud of yourselves, I hope. This is wonderful!
Flash Sentry: It is?
Vice Principal Luna: It's inspiring but still warm and welcoming. I love how your work is literally enmeshed. Truly excellent work, boys.
Flash Sentry: Uh, thank you! This is just what happens when you allow love to lead the way.
Micro Chips: With song.
Sandalwood: Through the self-replicating material present in nearly all living organisms.
Vice Principal Luna: [chuckles] That's great to hear. 
Now just add "Welcome Crystal Prep", and I'd like to see five more by 
the end of the day. Thanks, boys!
