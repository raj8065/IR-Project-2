Music to My EarsEdit[dubstep music]
[music stops]
Mrs. Cake: What can I get ya?
[music continues]
[school bell rings]
[music stops]
[music continues]
Guitar CenteredEditRarity: Rainbow Dash, I simply don't understand why you can't just play the guitar you have.
[sproing]
Rarity: [gasps] Now I understand.
Pinkie Pie: How about this one?
Rainbow Dash: No.
Pinkie Pie: Lookie here!
Rainbow Dash: No.
Pinkie Pie: Super groovy!
Rainbow Dash: No, Pinkie.
Applejack: Well, whatcha looking for?
Rainbow Dash: That's the problem! I need something that looks as awesome as I'm gonna make it sound. [gasps] Hands off my guitar, Trixie!
Trixie Lulamoon: I touched it first, Rainbow Dash!
Applejack: Sounds to me like this is a makin' for a nice, friendly competition.
Rainbow Dash: All right! Let's see who plays best!
Trixie Lulamoon: A shred-off?
Rainbow Dash: Shred on.
[electric guitar battle]
Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, and Rarity: [cheering]
Rainbow Dash: Check me out! Uh, she can have it. Turns out this is the one that really speaks to me.
Trixie Lulamoon: The Great and Powerful Trixie always wins in the end! [laughs]
Rainbow Dash: I doubt it.
Trixie Lulamoon: Twelve-thousand dollars?! You'll pay for this, Rainbow Dash!
Pinkie Pie: No, silly! If you want it, you have to pay for it.
Hamstocalypse NowEdit[door creaks]
Fluttershy: Thanks for coming, Rarity. The rescue center needs all the help it can get.
Rarity: Oh, but of course, darling. Helping cute little puppies and kitties will never go out of style.
Fluttershy: Once a year, a lucky volunteer gets to clean
 the hamster habitat. I signed up for it months ago to be sure I'd get 
it. [singsongy] Housecleaning!
Rarity: Ooh. Uh, Fluttershy, darling, aren't hamsters, uh, rodents?
Fluttershy: They sure are. But they're cute and cuddly 
like bunnies. Okay, everyhamster, follow Rarity into the next room. 
She'll take good care of you while I give your home a nice scrub.
[pounding on the glass]
[door opens]
Fluttershy: Rarity, what happened?!
Rarity: Oh! Aah! Well, uh, Carl Pettington's coat just 
begged to be accessorized, but Emilia Furhart refused to be left out and
 got Curtis Pawpower to chew right through Carl's little scarf, and 
before I knew it, I had a habitat-wide feud on my hands! [beat] Also, I 
named them.
Fluttershy: Ladies and gentlehamsters, please! Now, I know you're all upset, but why don't we head back into the habitat and talk it over?
Carl Pettington: [smooches]
Emilia Furhart: [squeaks angrily]
Fluttershy and Rarity: [gasp]
Curtis Pawpower: [frightened squeak]
[tambourine jingles]
[door closes]
Rarity: Huh! I never would have guessed hamsters could be so touchy about fashion!
Pinkie on the OneEditGranny Smith: Just remember, the most important thing 
about sugar butter cocoa cookies is to fold your batter. Too much arm 
turnin'll make your cookies tougher than a lump of coal.
Rainbow Dash: Come on, Pinkie. You're s'posed to help me find a drummer for my band.
Pinkie Pie: I guess I could fold a little faster.
[pots and pans clattering]
Rainbow Dash: Most people don't know how hard it is to find someone who could use both hands the way a drummer does.
Pinkie Pie: I'll bet!
[splat!]
Granny Smith: Uh...
Pinkie Pie: [squee]
Rainbow Dash: [grunts]
Rainbow Dash: Now, it's important that our banner look 
awesome! So feel free to use as much glitter as you want. A drummer 
can't just be anybody.
Pinkie Pie: Oh, of course not. [tapping on the glitter jar]
Rainbow Dash: They need to have the right instincts, you know?
Pinkie Pie: Totally! [continues drumming]
Rainbow Dash: [coughs]
Rainbow Dash: It's gotta be someone with a lot of...
Pinkie Pie: [squirts strawberry syrup]
Rainbow Dash: ...energy.
Pinkie Pie: Absolutely! [stirs glass] [drums on lunch tray]
Rainbow Dash: I mean, a lot! Energy, enthusiasm...
[plates and trays clattering]
Applejack: Pinkie!
Pinkie Pie: [stops drumming] Whaaaaaaat?! [resumes drumming with silverware]
Rainbow Dash: They have to be able to carry the whole band on their shoulders!
Pinkie Pie: [still drumming with silverware]
Rainbow Dash: Ugh! Pinkie!
Rarity: We've got to find an outlet for all that energy!
Pinkie Pie: [wild, fast drumming]
Fluttershy: [exclaims]
Applejack: Whoa!
Rainbow Dash: Cool!
Pinkie Pie: [cymbals crash] [pants]
Rarity: Whatever made you think of Pinkie for the drums?
Rainbow Dash: I dunno. Guess I just have a sense for these things.
Pinkie Pie: [plays sting]
Player PianoEditRarity: [grunts and pants] Come on, Rarity! You simply must
 get this piano to band practice! [grunts and pants] What kind of person
 doesn't put a piano on wheels? [grunts, groans] Just look at me. I'm a 
mess. What I need is a bit more muscle. [to Rover, Fido, and Spot] Oh, 
boys!
Rarity: I simply cannot thank you enough. And while I am a
 bit repulsed by your musky smell, I can appreciate that you're all 
diamonds in the rough.
[students scream]
Rarity: Excuse me! Pardon me! Excuse me! Thank you!
Rover, Fido, and Spot: [panting]
Pinkie Pie: [drums]
Rainbow Dash: Ugh! Where is Rarity?!
Applejack: That gal probably just wants to make some sort of grand entrance.
Rarity: Tada!
Applejack: Told ya.
Rainbow Dash: Rarity, couldn't you have chosen a more portable instrument?
Rarity: Heavens, no! The grand piano is the most refined
 and elegant of instruments. With it, I will be able to express my full 
musicality.
[kitchen timer goes off]
Rainbow Dash: Well, our time's up. I guess we'll have to move our practice to the gym.
Applejack: Guess you're gonna express your "full musicality" clear across campus.
Rarity: Huh? Awww...
Pinkie Pie: Or you could play this! It's part guitar, part keyboard! It's a guitarkey!
Rainbow Dash: You mean a keytar.
Pinkie Pie: Po-tay-to, to-mah-to.
Rarity: [plays keytar] Ooh! Oooh! Oh, my!
Applejack: Well, look at that!
Rainbow Dash: Cool!
Pinkie Pie: [gasps] Wowee!
Fluttershy: Oh, my goodness!
Applejack: Well, then, how about ya take that keytar and move your tail to our next rehearsal space?
Rarity: Fine, fine. [to Rover, Fido, and Spot] I don't suppose... [plays keytar riff]
A Case for the BassEditApplejack: Okay, Granny, one more time. When ya accidentally sold my bass at the garage sale, who did ya sell it to?
Granny Smith: [stammers] I sold it to the owners of that new pawn shop. Uh, Flibbity Flabbity, somethin' like that.
[bell rings]
Flim: Welcome to the grand opening of the Flim Flam Brothers' Everything Under the Sun Emporium!
Flam: If you want it...
Flim and Flam: ...we've got it!
Flim: Need a pogo stick?
Flam: A bowling ball?
Flim: A stuffed clown?
Flam: Whatever this is?
Applejack: I'd like that bass.
Flim: I can give you this bass for a non-negotiable price of one thousand dollars.
Rarity: Why, you only paid Granny Smith two dollars for it!
Flim: Yes, well, we have to cover our overhead and transportation costs.
Applejack: Listen, Granny never should've sold my bass. I'll give ya the two dollars back and we'll call it even.
Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy and Rarity: [agreeing]
Flim and Flam: Likely story!
Applejack: It is. That's my bass.
Flim: And can you prove that this is, in fact, your bass?
Rarity: Her initials are monogrammed right on the strap.
Flam: That could mean anything. It could stand for...
Flim: "Aardvark Junior"...
Flam: "Anvil Jokers"...
Flim: Or "Animal Jane".
Flam: Why, I'll bet you don't even play the bass, Applejack -- if that is your real name.
Rainbow Dash: Of course that's her real name!
Pinkie Pie: And she does play the bass!
Applejack: [plays slap bass solo]
Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy and Rarity: [cheering]
Flim: Perhaps this is her bass. But there are still the transportation costs and overhead.
Flam: Don't forget the stocking fees.
Flim: Wouldn't dream of it, brother!
Applejack: [sighs]
Flam: Then again, I suppose we could make some sort of trade?
Applejack: Come on down to the grand opening of the Flim Flam Brothers' Everything Under the Sun Emporium.
Granny Smith: Since when do you play the bass?

Perfect Day for Fun!Edit[The Rainbooms]
Oh, aw aw oh, oh, oh, aw oh uh
Oh, aw aw oh, oh, oh

Looking forward to some fun
Knowing all our friends will come
'Cause we're here to spend the day
Everybody come and play

Let's all pick a meeting place
And we're gonna have to race
Everybody follow me
This is where we're gonna be!

With my best friends, though we're different
We feel like we still belong
And every day it makes our friendship strong

Let's go find some games to win
Everybody's joining in
'Cause we're having such a blast

Applejack: Hey, did I just come in last?
[The Rainbooms]
Doesn't matter win or lose
When we always are amused

Having fun and laughing loud!

With my best friends, we can depend
They will always follow through
It's a perfect day for fun when I spend it with you

Oh, aw aw oh, oh, oh, aw oh uh
Oh, aw aw oh, oh, oh

Taking photos with my friends
Never want this day to end

Doesn't matter what your age
Hear the music, now's your chance
Everybody start to dance!

With my best friends, though we're different
We feel like we still belong
And every day it makes our friendship strong

With my best friends, we can depend
They will always follow through
There's a guarantee for fun when I spend it with you

My Past is Not TodayEdit[Sunset Shimmer]
Power
Was all I desired (I desired, all I desired)
But all that grew inside me
Was the darkness I acquired

When I began to fall
And I lost the path ahead
That's when your friendship found me
And it lifted me instead

Like a phoenix burning bright
In the sky
I'll show there's another side to me
You can't deny

I may not know what the future holds
But hear me when I say
That my past does not define me
'Cause my past is not today

Ambition
Is what I believed
Would be the only way
To set me free

But when it disappeared
And I found myself alone
That's when you came and got me
And it felt like I was home

Like a phoenix burning bright
In the sky
I'll show there's another side to me
You can't deny

I may not know what the future holds
But hear me when I say
That my past does not define me
'Cause my past is not today

Friendship Through the AgesEdit[Twilight Sparkle]
Nothing stays the same for long
But when it changes doesn't mean it's gone
Time will always get away
As it leaves behind another day

[Fluttershy]
Things may come and things may go
Some go fast and some go slow
Few things last, that's all I know
But friendship carries on through the ages

[Rarity and Fluttershy]
Things may come and things may go
Some go fast and some go slow
Few things last, that's all I know
But friendship carries on through the ages

[Rainbow Dash]
Been around for a long time
Rocking out hard 'cause I'm in my prime
Maybe it'll change further down the line
But my friendship carries on through the ages

[Applejack]
Every single style has something
Different it can say
There's nothing wrong with being unique
And special in your own way

[Pinkie Pie]
Maybe you wanna be a pop star
Get your fifteen minutes of fame, wha, ah! Ah, oh!
That won't last forever
But friendship remains the same, ah-oh, oh!




[The Rainbooms sans Sunset Shimmer]
Things may come and things may go
Some go fast and some go slow
Few things last, that's all I know
But friendship carries on through the ages



[Rarity]
But friendship carries on





[The Rainbooms]
Things may come and things may go
Some go fast and some go slow
Few things last, that's all I know
But friendship carries on through the ages



[Rarity]
But friendship carries on


Ohhh-oh, carries on...

Life is a RunwayEdit[Rarity]
Life is a runway (runway)
Listen, here's what it's all about
I tell you, life is a runway (runway)
Time to bring what's on the inside out

Into the light
Into the light

Life is a runway
When you see it my way
Take all the good inside
Make it beautiful
Fashion is a way to start
Showing what's in your heart
Call it superficial
I call it irrefutable

Oh-oh, oh wha-oh
Oh-oh, oh wha-oh
Oh-oh, oh wha-oh
Life is a runway

You can be the girl
That you want to be
With a little love
And some accessories (life is a runway)
Don't be scared to show you have
Personal style
Just go do your thing
You'll make everyone smile (life is a runway)
