Sunset Shimmer: I got your text, Rainbow Dash! Did 
something come through the portal? Is Equestrian magic on the loose? Did
 Twilight come back with a problem that only we can solve?!
Pinkie Pie: Has a giant cake monster covered all the cakes in the world in cake?!
Rainbow Dash: Um, not exactly.
Sunset Shimmer: Uh, I don't understand.
Applejack: Well, Sunset, I was just tellin' Rainbow Dash here that a broken guitar string doesn't really qualify as an emergency.
Rainbow Dash: It totally does!
Rarity: Really, Rainbow Dash! I was in the middle of sewing a very complex appliqué on my latest frock.
Fluttershy: And I was just about to tuck everyone in for the night at the shelter. Now we'll have to start stories all over again.
Sunset Shimmer: Why would you send all of us an emergency text for a guitar string?
Rainbow Dash: Well, I was going to pony up and show our 
fans some awesome guitar licks, but I kinda need all six strings to do 
it. Got any extra?
All but Rainbow Dash: [groan]
Sunset Shimmer: Here. But everyone finished practicing for the day. I'm pretty sure all the music rooms are locked.
Rainbow Dash: No problem. The acoustics in the hallway are perfect for power chords. [plays chord] C'mon! Let's go!
Applejack: You comin', Sunset?
Sunset Shimmer: I'll catch up in a bit. [voiceover] Dear
 Princess Twilight, how's life treating you in Equestria? Any cool new 
magic spells? It's been pretty quiet here at CHS since the Battle of the
 Bands. We still pony up when we play music, which Rainbow Dash just 
loves to show off. But I still can't quite grasp what it's all about. I 
would love to hear what you think about it when you get a sec. Your 
friend, Sunset Shimmer.
[bus pulls up]
[bus drives away]
[electronic noises]
Sunset Shimmer: Hey! What are you doing?! Wait! Stop!
[car skids]
Sunset Shimmer: Who was that?
Sci-Twi: [sighs]
[All]
Ahhh-ohhh...
Ahhh-ohhh...
Na, na, na-na-na, oh

Ha!

Ahhh-ohhh...
The Friendship Games!

[guitar intro]

We've come this far
And we're not goin' back (No way!)
Prepare yourself
Cause we're on the attack (Attack!)

Won't have to find us
We'll be tracking you down (Right now!)
And when we're finished
We'll be takin' the crown

All the way (all the way)
All the way to the Friendship Games
Na, na, na-na-na, oh
Na, na, let's go!

All the way (all the way)
All the way to the Friendship Games
Na, na, na-na-na, oh
Na, na, let's go!

Hey! Ho!
Hey! Let's go!

[Rainbow Dash]
We studied hard
And we're here to win

[All]
Whoa-oh

[Applejack]
We're only tellin' you once

[Sunset Shimmer]
Our magic comes from the inside out

[Main six]
What you see's what you get
Don't you ever forget

[All]
All the way (all the way)
All the way to the Friendship Games
Na, na, na-na-na, oh
Na, na, let's go!

All the way (all the way)
All the way to the Friendship Games
Na, na, na-na-na, oh
Na, na, let's go!

Na, na, na-na-na, oh
Na, na, let's go!
[softer] Na, na, na-na-na, oh
Na, na, let's go!
[even softer] Na, na, na-na-na, oh
Na, na, let's go!

Sunset Shimmer: She was definitely doing something to the statue – or was going to.
Fluttershy: Do you think she came through the portal from Equestria?
Sunset Shimmer: No, I'm pretty sure I woulda noticed that. I think she was from over here.
Applejack: Well, that's a relief. The last thing we need
 is another magical so-and-so bent on world domination comin' over from 
Equestria.
Rarity: Agreed. I have no interest in another fight 
against the powers of evil magic. The wear and tear on my wardrobe is 
just too much to keep up with.
Sunset Shimmer: Still, a mysterious figure snooping around the portal? Don't you wanna know what she was up to?
Fluttershy: [shudders] I don't even wanna guess.
Rainbow Dash: Well, you don't have to. Because I've totally figured out who it was!
Pinkie Pie: Ooh, ooh! A nighttime statue cleaner? A magical portal maintenance maintainer? A gardener?!
Rainbow Dash: Seeing as how they got off a bus from the city and got back on a bus headed to the city, I'll bet they go to...
All but Sunset Shimmer: Crystal Prep.
Rainbow Dash: Yep. With the Friendship Games starting tomorrow, they'd totally try to prank us by defacing the Wondercolts statue.
Sunset Shimmer: Why would anyone take a bus all the way from the city for that?
Applejack: Because the Crystal Prep Shadowbolts are our biggest rivals?
Rarity: Because that's just what the students at Crystal Prep would do?
Rainbow Dash: Because even though they beat us in everything – soccer, tennis, golf – they still have to gloat!
Sunset Shimmer: Seems kinda silly to me.
All but Sunset Shimmer: Silly?!
Rainbow Dash: So I guess you think the Friendship Games are silly, too.
Sunset Shimmer: Well, it's not like we'll be fighting the powers of evil magic.
Fluttershy: No. We'll be fighting against a school full of meanies. Not everything has to be magical to be important.
Sunset Shimmer: You're right. I'm sorry. I know it's a big deal.
Rarity: [scoffs] That's putting it mildly, darling. They're still revamping the playing field in preparation.
Sunset Shimmer: I just don't understand why there's this
 big rivalry. Aren't the "Friendship Games" supposed to be about our two
 schools getting along?
Applejack: Well, it's kinda hard to get along with someone who beats you at everything.
Rainbow Dash: Not anymore! This time, things are gonna be different.
Sunset Shimmer: What do you mean?
Rainbow Dash: Oh, you'll find out.
Principal Celestia: As I am sure you all know, tomorrow, 
Canterlot High School will be hosting our fellow students from Crystal 
Prep Academy as we join together in the spirit of excellence, 
sportsmanship, and fidelity to compete in the Friendship Games.
Students: [unenthused cheering, sparse applause]
Principal Celestia: Since the games only happen every four years, I'm sure you're all curious what goes on.
Flash Sentry: You mean other than us losing?!
Principal Celestia: And that is exactly why I've asked Rainbow Dash to come up and give you all a little, um... context.
[microphone feedback]
Rainbow Dash: Thank you, Principal Celestia. [clears 
throat] I know a lot of you might think there's no way we can beat a 
fancy school like Crystal Prep at anything.
Pinkie Pie: Unless it's a "losing to Crystal Prep" competition! 'Cause we're really good at that!
Rainbow Dash: [groans] And I know that CHS has never won the Friendship Games even once.
Rarity: Oh, dear. I hope this speech isn't meant to be motivational.
Rainbow Dash: Crystal Prep students are super athletic, super smart, and super motivated. But there's one thing they aren't. They aren't Wondercolts!
We've fought magic more than once
And come out on top

[Chorus]
Oh, oh

[Rainbow Dash]
There's other schools, but none can make those claims

[Chorus]
Na, na-na-na-na, oh

[Rainbow Dash]
Together we are Canterlot
Come and cheer our name

[Chorus]
Oh, oh

[Rainbow Dash]
This will be our year to win these games

[Rainbow Dash and chorus]
We'll always be Wondercolts forever
And now our time has finally arrived
'Cause we believe in the magic of friendship
And you know, at the end of the day, it is we who survive

[instrumental break]

[Students]
Hey!

[Rainbow Dash]
We're not the school we were before

[Students]
Before!

[Rainbow Dash]
Yeah, we're different now




[Chorus]
Oh, oh



[Students]
Hey, hey!


[Rainbow Dash]
We overcame the obstacles we faced

[Chorus]
Overcame the obstacles we faced

[Students]
Hey!

[Rainbow Dash]
We're Canterlot united

[Students]
Unite!

[Rainbow Dash]
And we'll never bow




[Chorus]
Oh, oh



[Students]
Hey, hey!


[Rainbow Dash]
So get ready to see us in first place

[All]
We'll always be Wondercolts forever
(Three! Two! One! Go!)
And now our time has finally arrived
(Our time is now!)
'Cause we believe in the magic of friendship
And you know, at the end of the day, it is we who survive
At the end of the day, it is we who survive

Na, na, na-na-na-na
Wondercolts united together
Na, na, na-na-na-na
Wondercolts united forever




Na, na, na-na-na-na
Wondercolts united together
Na, na, na-na-na-na
Wondercolts united forever


Na, na, na-na-na-na
Wondercolts united together



[Rainbow Dash]
We'll always be Wondercolts forever
And now our time has finally arrived
'Cause we believe in the magic of friendship
And you know...


At the end of the day, it is we who survive
At the end of the day, it is we who survive!

[students cheering]
Fluttershy: Rainbow Dash, that was amazing! Even I feel like we can win!
Rarity: I feel like my school pride is at an all-time high!
Applejack: Is anybody else wonderin' how Dash ponied up without playin' her guitar?
Rainbow Dash: I know, right? It's probably because I'm so awesome!
Sunset Shimmer: Maybe. I mean, you are awesome, but there's gotta be more to it than that, right? It just seems so random.
Vice Principal Luna: Well, it would be nice if you girls
 could get a handle on it. We'd like to keep magic as far away from the 
Friendship Games as possible. We don't want to be accused of cheating.
Rarity: We don't need magic to defeat those hoity-toity Crystal Preppers.
All but Rarity, Sunset Shimmer, and Luna: [agreeing]
Rarity: [giggles]
Vice Principal Luna: Still, the Friendship Games are 
serious business. We don't want any surprises. Especially the kind that 
could cause us to forfeit. Sunset Shimmer, you came here from a world of
 magic. Perhaps you can get to the bottom of our magical development.
Sunset Shimmer: I'll do my best.
Rainbow Dash: Okay. Anybody have any guesses what the events are gonna be?
Pinkie Pie: Pie eating? Cake eating? [gasps] Pie-cake eating?!
Applejack: They won't even let us see what they're doin'
 to the field. You think they'd at least tell competitors what they're 
competing in.
Fluttershy: It could be anything.
Rarity: Anything?! How will I ever pick the right outfit?!
Sunset Shimmer: I really wanna help, but I think I better go focus on figuring out why Rainbow Dash ponied up. See ya later!
Pinkie Pie: Seems like she's got everything under control. Nothing to worry about.
Sunset Shimmer: Ugh! [sighs] [voiceover] Hey, 
Twilight. Haven't heard back from you yet. I guess you must be pretty 
busy with your role as princess. But I could really use your advice 
right now. You see, I've been given the job of keeping magic under 
control here at CHS, even though I still haven't quite wrapped my head 
around it. And now after seeing Rainbow Dash pony up the way she did, it
 makes me think her magic might be... changing. Everyone is looking to 
me to figure things out and I really don't wanna let them down. But I'm 
not sure I have enough experience with friendship magic to solve this.
[school bell rings]
Sci-Twi: [deep breath] Excuse me. Sorry. Pardon me.
Puppy Spike: [pants]
[door opens]
Puppy Spike: [whimpers]
Sci-Twi: Spike? Spike?!
Puppy Spike: [barks]
Sci-Twi: [giggles] There you are.
Puppy Spike: [barks] [licks]
Sci-Twi: Okay, okay! Last night's field test confirmed 
it, Spike. With this device, I can track and contain the bizarre energy 
coming from Canterlot High.
Puppy Spike: [growls]
Sci-Twi: I know you didn't like me going over there, but
 I just couldn't wait. And soon, I'll have all the time I need. All of 
Crystal Prep is gonna be there for the Friendship Games. I just hope all
 that "rivalry" nonsense doesn't get in the way of my research. If I can
 collect enough data on these EM frequencies, I should be able to 
extrapolate the waveforms to determine their origin. That would 
practically guarantee my entrance into the Everton Independent Study 
Program! Whoa!
[knock on door]
Dean Cadance: Twilight, you know the rules against pets.
Sci-Twi: Well, Spike isn't a pet, Dean Cadance. He's the
 focus of my research project. Human-canine cohabitation: effects and 
implications.
Dean Cadance: If you say so. But Principal Cinch is highly allergic, so I suggest you put on a clean shirt.
Sci-Twi: Why?
Dean Cadance: Because she wants to see you.
Sci-Twi: Ooh! Maybe she has news about my application to Everton!
Dean Cadance: I've been meaning to talk to you about that. Are you sure that's what you really want?
Sci-Twi: Why wouldn't it be? A program that allows me to
 focus all my attention on my own advanced math and science projects? 
What a dream come true!
Dean Cadance: But there aren't any classrooms with other students. You'll be doing everything on your own.
Sci-Twi: That is why it's called an "independent study program".
Dean Cadance: I just don't want you to miss out on 
anything. That's all. Being around other people isn't a bad thing. 
Sometimes it's how you learn the most about yourself.
Sci-Twi: I guess.
Dean Cadance: Meet you in Principal Cinch's office in a few minutes?
[door closes]
Sci-Twi: [to Puppy Spike] What's she so worried about? 
Everton is exactly what I need right now. [sighs] It's not like I have 
anything left to learn at Crystal Prep.
[Sci-Twi]
I've walked through all these halls before
I've been in and out of every door, oh-whoa-oh
There's nothin' in this school that I don't know
In every class, my grade's the best
The highest score on every test
I think that means it's time for me to go

I know there's more that's out there
And I just haven't found it yet
I know there's more that's out there
Another me I haven't met

This school is full of people
But still I don't belong
They only dream of winning
Look at me like something's wrong
Maybe I'm better off alone
Will I find what I'm lookin' for
If I just do it on my own?

I know there's more that's out there
Something to fill this hole inside
I know there's more that's out there
And I'm not afraid to try

There's only so much this school can offer
And I'm not saying that it's wrong
But I know there's more that's out there
'Cause I've been searching all along

Beyond these rooms, beyond these walls
So much to learn, I can't see it all
There's somethin' out there callin' me
And it's a mystery that I can't wait to see

'Cause I know there's more that's out there
Another place, another way
And I know there's more that's out there
And I'll find out someday!

I'll find out someday...

[door creaks]
[chair squeaks]
[door creaks]
Sci-Twi: Shining Armor? Why is my brother here?
Dean Cadance: As an alumni, Principal Cinch thought he could provide some unique perspective.
Sci-Twi: Perspective on what?
Principal Cinch: Why, the Friendship Games, of course. You competed in the games, did you not, Shining Armor?
Shining Armor: [ahem] I did.
Principal Cinch: And you happen to recall who won?
Shining Armor: Ha ha, Crystal Prep did. We always win.
Principal Cinch: We always win.
Sci-Twi: Why did you ask to see me?
Principal Cinch: Twilight, I'll be honest. It doesn't 
matter whether or not Crystal Prep wins or loses. [monkeyshine squeaks] 
The important thing is we are expected to win because Crystal 
Prep has a reputation. And it is that reputation... my reputation that 
is responsible for everything we have here. For everything you've done 
here. And you've done quite a lot, haven't you?
Sci-Twi: I don't know. I guess.
Principal Cinch: Oh, don't be modest. You're the best 
student this school has ever seen. What I can't understand is why my 
best student wouldn't want to compete.
Sci-Twi: In the Friendship Games?
Shining Armor: Look, Twily, I know it's not really your 
thing, but representing the school is kind of a big deal. Plus, they 
could really use your help.
Principal Cinch: It seems Canterlot High is undergoing 
something of a renaissance. Test scores are up, grades, even athletics 
are on the rise. You see, they are developing somewhat of a reputation. 
This can not happen!
Sci-Twi: Principal Cinch, I can't possibly participate in the games. My work here is very—
Principal Cinch: Ah, yes. Your work. Cadance, could you and Shining Armor find my contact sheet for the Everton Independent Study program?
Dean Cadance: Of course.
[door closes]
Principal Cinch: I understand you've applied. You see, 
one of the advantages of having a reputation is a certain amount of 
influence in such things. So, let me offer you a deal. In return for 
contributing your agile mind to these games, I will use my influence to 
guarantee your application is approved. Though, I suppose I could also 
have it... denied. What do you think I should do?
Puppy Spike: [growls]
Sci-Twi: Ugh! Come on, Spike! I was always gonna go to Canterlot High for the Friendship Games. Ich! The only difference now is that I have to compete. Besides, it's not like Principal Cinch gave me much of a choice.
Puppy Spike: [whimpers]
Sci-Twi: I know, Spike. I don't like it either. I 
probably won't be able to collect anywhere near as much data as I 
thought. But maybe I can still get some.
Puppy Spike: [whimpers]
Sci-Twi: Spike, I wouldn't leave without you. Just remember to be quiet. And try not to shed.
[door creaks]
Sci-Twi: Dean Cadance, I'm not really sure where to go.
Dean Cadance: One second, Twilight.
Sour Sweet: [sourly] You could try the end of the line!
Sci-Twi: What did you say?
Sour Sweet: [sweetly] Just that someone as smart as you should definitely go first.
Sci-Twi: I... I didn't mean to. I was just asking.
Dean Cadance: This is the right bus, Twilight. Go ahead.
Sci-Twi: But... I didn't mean to cut in front.
Sour Sweet: [sourly] [scoffs] Well, it's too late now.
[bus door opens]
Indigo Zap: Are we gonna win?!?!
Sci-Twi: I... I don't know.
Indigo Zap: Wrong answer!! Try again! Are we gonna win?!?!
Sci-Twi: Um... I guess? I-It's just... I mean... I heard
 that CHS is doing well now. With their reputation. And, I mean, it's 
not better than ours, of course. But we can't let them do it, you know? 
Win, I mean? Right?
Bus Driver: You're gonna have to take a seat!
Sci-Twi: Hi, Sugarcoat.
Sugarcoat: That was a really bad speech. You should consider not speaking in public.
[engine starts]
Sci-Twi: Well, Spike, at least I've got you with me.
[rock music playing on headphones]
Lemon Zest: Dude, you have gotta hear this!
Sci-Twi: Uh? Eh!
[Rainbooms practicing]
Rainbow Dash: I hope the Friendship Games have a music competition, because we would totally rock it! [plays chord]
Sunset Shimmer: Um, we're supposed to keep magic out of the Friendship Games, remember?
Rainbow Dash: [scoffs]
Rarity: Easier said than done, darling. I'm sure in Equestria, magic does whatever you want. But...
Sunset Shimmer: This isn't Equestria.
Applejack: Well, when it comes to magic, I'm sure you'll figure it out.
Rarity: And while Sunset works on keeping the magic out of the games, I've been working on what to put in! [giggles]
Applejack: Rarity, what'd you go an' do?
Rarity: Well, I had a little time on my hands, and since we don't know what the Friendship Games' events are, I made a few options for uniforms!
Rainbow Dash: You really didn't have to do that.
Rarity: I know.
Applejack: No. You really didn't have to.
Rarity: I know! [giggles]
Principal Celestia: Vice Principal Luna can help your 
students get settled if you'd like me to show you around, Principal 
Cinch. There have been quite a few changes since your last visit.
Principal Cinch: Oh, yes, Principal Celestia. I'm sure that would be fascinating.
Vice Principal Luna: Oh, it's always such a pleasure to see you, Dean Cadance. Even if it means another defeat.
Dean Cadance: Thank you, Vice Principal Luna, but I hear it's not going to be so easy this time.
Indigo Zap: Comin' through!
[thud]
Sci-Twi: Oof!
Sunny Flare: Seriously?
Sci-Twi: Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to. [groans] [to Sour Sweet] Oh, sorry. Why don't you go ahead?
Sour Sweet: [sweetly] You are such a sweetie! [sourly and hushed] I am watching you!
[rock music on headphones]
Lemon Zest: Ahh! Yeah! [rocking out sounds]
Sugarcoat: You are kinda being a doormat right now.
[device hums]
Sweetie Drops: Hi, Twilight.
"Cherry Crash": Hey, Twilight!
"Sweet Leaves": Hi, Twilight.
"Mystery Mint": Hi, Twilight.
"Scribble Dee": Hey, you. Lookin' good.
Sci-Twi: Um, hi.
"Sophisticata": Hey, what's happenin'?
"Blueberry Cake": Really nice to see you.
"Velvet Sky": Twilight, how ya doin'?
"Starlight": Twilight, yo! [clicks tongue]
Sci-Twi: Hi. Hello. Uh, good.
[thud]
Flash Sentry: Twilight? I almost didn't recognize you. When did you start wearin' glasses?
Sci-Twi: Um, like, since forever.
Flash Sentry: Oh, so how long are you here for?
Sci-Twi: Just for the Friendship Games.
Flash Sentry: Right. Of course. We'll totally win with you here.
[device beeping]
Sci-Twi: Uh, I gotta go.
Flash Sentry: Uh, okay. Bye? Aw.
Applejack: Uh, Rarity, these outfits are great, but why 
would you put so much time and effort into clothes we might not even 
wear? You're gonna exhaust yourself before the games even start.
Rarity: Oh, pff. Kch. Fff. Ts! Don't be silly, darling! 
Putting effort into clothes is what I live for, and spending time on my 
friends fills me with energy!
All but Rarity: [amazed reactions]
Sunset Shimmer: And magic, too, I guess.
[device continues beeping]
Rarity: [out of breath] Actually, Applejack, now that you mention it, I suppose I could use a tiny break. [faints]
Applejack: I told you.
[door opens]
All but Sci-Twi: Twilight?
Sci-Twi: Uh, yes?
Applejack: Well, I'll be. You shoulda told us you were comin'.
Rarity: Darling, those glasses. What are you wearing? It's so... severe.
Sci-Twi: My uniform?
Fluttershy: Your uniform for what?
Sci-Twi: For... Crystal Prep. But why does everyone at this school know who I am?
Rainbow Dash: Did you just say "Crystal Prep"?
Puppy Spike: [barks]
Fluttershy and Rarity: Spike!
Sci-Twi: [gasps] You know my dog's name, too?
Principal Celestia: And our music program has especially taken off. [gasps] Twilight?
Sci-Twi: This is getting ridiculous!
Principal Cinch: I must apologize for the curiosity of my prized student.
Principal Celestia: Your student?
Principal Cinch: The smart ones are always curious. I'll return her to check in with the rest of her classmates.
Principal Celestia: I didn't know Twilight had a twin sister.
Pinkie Pie: She doesn't! That Twilight is obviously the Twilight from this
 world since it couldn't possibly be the Twilight from the pony world 
since the Twilight from the pony world doesn't go to Crystal Prep or 
wear glasses.
Principal Celestia: Nevermind.
Sci-Twi: I'm sorry, Principal Cinch. I was just following these strange readings. Actually, they led me to those girls and—
Principal Cinch: Twilight, what you do in your free time
 is of little interest to me, but while you're here, I... all of Crystal
 Prep, in fact, require your complete focus.
Sci-Twi: But why does everyone at this school seem to know me?
Principal Cinch: Perhaps they're trying to confuse you. Perhaps they're trying to lure you away.
Sci-Twi: It didn't feel like anyone was trying to lure me.
Principal Cinch: I don't know what they're planning, but I guarantee, it isn't to help us win.
Rarity: I can't believe our world's Twilight goes to Crystal Prep!
Rainbow Dash: You're saying that Twilight's gonna play against us? She'd never do that!
Fluttershy: Our Twilight wouldn't.
Sunset Shimmer: [angrily] Our Twilight is a princess in Equestria and an expert in friendship magic! And if she
 was here, we'd have already figured out why magic is randomly popping 
up during pep rallies and costume changes. [deep breath] Sorry. I'm just
 frustrated that I haven't heard back from her.
Applejack: She's a princess in Equestria. Probably got problems of her own to deal with.
Rarity: We certainly can't expect her to drop everything
 and pop through the portal whenever. Especially if it's to deal with 
something as minor as a few random pony-ups.
Sunset Shimmer: But they aren't minor! Magic came into 
this world when I stole Twilight's crown. It's taken a lot for me to 
earn everyone's trust. If we have to forfeit the games because I can't 
think of a way to keep it under control...
Fluttershy: Oh, Sunset, I'm sure you'll be able to figure things out.
Applejack: You're the one who helped us understand what was goin' on with the sirens. Remember?
Sunset Shimmer: I guess. But Twilight was the one who really figured out what we needed to defeat them.
Rarity: But don't you remember, darling? What we needed to defeat them was you.
Sunset Shimmer: [sighs] All right.
All but Sunset Shimmer: [cheering]
Rainbow Dash: Come on, guys! Let's see if we can find any info about the events and come up with a strategy. You comin', Sunset?
Sunset Shimmer: I'll... catch up with you guys in a bit.
Sunset Shimmer: [sighs] Still no reply.
[device humming]
Sunset Shimmer: Maybe there's another way I could reach her. Hey, let go!
[whoosh]
Sci-Twi and Sunset Shimmer: [scream]
Sunset Shimmer: What did you do?!
Dean Cadance: Twilight, you have to check in with the others.
Sunset Shimmer: Where's the portal? [grunts] Where's the portal?!
[cup crunches]
Applejack: What do ya mean the portal's gone?
Sunset Shimmer: I mean it's gone. It's closed. It's not there anymore!
Rainbow Dash: How'd that happen?
Sunset Shimmer: I don't know. But it has something to do with that Twilight.
Applejack: What in tarnation is she up to?
Indigo Zap: Huh?
[splat]
Indigo Zap: [snarls]
Sunset Shimmer: Leave this to me. Twilight, what have you been up to?
Sci-Twi: Me? Oh, I was just, uh—
Indigo Zap: Who wants to know?!
Rainbow Dash: Um, we do.
Applejack: All right, everyone. Let's not get too competitive before the games even start.
Sugarcoat: The games aren't really competitive since we've never lost.
Fluttershy: That's not a very nice thing to say.
Sunny Flare: Sorry, dearie, but these games aren't about being nice.
Rarity: Well, you might use a little tact.
Pinkie Pie: Hi, I'm Pinkie Pie!
Sci-Twi: Oh, hi. I'm Twilight.
Pinkie Pie: I know. You look just like my friend. Her name is Twilight too.
Sci-Twi: That's... heh, weird.
Pinkie Pie: What's that?
Sci-Twi: It's sort of a spectrometer. I built it to track EM frequencies, but it can also contain anomalies. [beat] It measures things.
Pinkie Pie: Like the party?
Sci-Twi: Yeah, though it doesn't look like much of a party to me.
Pinkie Pie: I know. Something is definitely missing. Come on!
Sci-Twi: Aah!
Principal Celestia: Hello, everyone! I'd like to take 
this opportunity to greet all of our visitors from Crystal Prep Academy 
and welcome them to CHS.
Sci-Twi: [grunts] What in the world is in these?
Pinkie Pie: Party cannons, of course!
Principal Celestia: And lastly, I would like to 
recognize the twelve students that CHS has elected to compete. I don't 
think we could have chosen a better group to represent the excellence, 
sportsmanship, and friendship the games stand for.
[party music]
[everyone conversing]
Sci-Twi: Um, are you sure this is a good idea?
Pinkie Pie: Absolutely!
[party cannon squeak]
[everyone talking]
Pinkie Pie: Ooh, floaty!
[device humming]
[whoosh]
Pinkie Pie: Aw! Oh. I am party pooped.
[flash]
[device closes, powers down]
[thumping on microphone]
[feedback]
[record scratch]
[music stops]
Principal Cinch: I'd like to thank Principal Celestia 
for her unconventional welcome. It's been four years since the last 
Friendship Games, but it feels as though nothing has changed. Canterlot 
High continues to pick its competitors in a popularity contest and 
Crystal Prep continues to field its top twelve students. It is a comfort
 to know that even after so many years of losses, your school remains committed to its ideals, however misguided they may be. I wish you all the best of luck, regardless of the inevitable outcome.
Pinkie Pie: Oh.
Applejack: I'm sorry, Pinkie. I thought your party additions were really swell.
Fluttershy: They definitely broke the ice.
Rarity: Yes. If only that Principal Cinch hadn't frozen it again.
Pinkie Pie: Yeah, she's awful.
Sunset Shimmer: Wow, Pinkie, what happened to you?
Pinkie Pie: I don't know. Everyone started having fun after Twilight and I fired the party cannons and I ponied up.
Sunset Shimmer: Of course you did.
Pinkie Pie: But then the magic just drained right out of me.
Sunset Shimmer: Wait, what do you mean "drained out of you"?
Applejack: Hey. Where is that other Twilight?
Pinkie Pie: Oh. She's right... Uh, well, she was right here.
Vice Principal Luna: [over P.A. system] Good morning, 
students. I'm sure you're all thrilled to start the first day of the 
Friendship Games. Our competitors will face off in every aspect of the 
CHS curriculum, culminating in the elimination equation finale.
Dean Cadance: Welcome to the first event, the Academic 
Decathlon! You'll be scored on chemistry, home-ec and everything in 
between. But remember, only the six students from each team with the 
most points will move on to event number 2. Good luck!
[Sunset Shimmer and Wondercolts]
Ho! We're gonna take you down
Ho! We're gonna take you down!
Take you down! (Ho! We're gonna take you down!)
Take you down! (Down, down, down)

[Sci-Twi and Shadowbolts]
(Oh oh!) We're here to take you out
(Aw aw!) We're here to take you out (Aw aw!)
Take you out! (We're here to take you out!)
Take you out!

[Wondercolts]
We're not about to let you win, so get out of our way
Think you got us beat, but we're here to stay
United strong, yeah, we'll take you down
You're not so tough, now you're in our town

All of the times we lost before
Not about to give up, we're only bringin' it more
We can smell your fear, we can see your sweat
Hope you didn't spend money 'cause you're losin' this bet!

You've got nothin' on us
Na, na, na-na-na, na
Let's go, Wondercolts!
You've got nothin' on us
Na, na, na-na-na, na
Let's go, Wondercolts!

[Shadowbolts]
Talk a little too much for a school that never wins
Maybe you should just stop 'fore you even begin
We are Crystal Prep High and we have a reputation
Every little moment is about our education

Put your ear to the ground
Listen to that sound
You're a house of cards
And it's about to fall down (fall down)
About to fall down (fall down), hit the ground

You've got nothin' on us
Na, na, na-na-na, na
Let's go, Shadowbolts!
You've got nothin' on us
Na, na, na-na-na, na
Let's go, Shadowbolts!

[Wondercolts]
Pressure's on, now we're gonna beat you
Step aside, it's time that we defeat you
Crystal Prep yourself 'cause you're about to go
Down, down, down, down

[Shadowbolts]
Pressure's on, you know we're gonna take you
Just give up before we have to break you
Canter-not-a-lot, you're about to go
Down, down, down, down

[Wondercolts]
Take it up to the top
'Cause we know we can win

[Shadowbolts]
Maybe you should just stop
'Cause we've seen you give in

[Wondercolts]
We believe in ourselves
And we've got what it takes

[All]
And we're not gonna stop

[Sci-Twi]
I can't wait 'til this is all over
There's so much more that's going on

[Sunset Shimmer]
And before these games are over
I'll find out just what she's done

[All]
Can she do it? Will she make it?
Who will win it? Who will take it?

Can she do it? Who will take it?
Did she win it? Did she make it?

Who's the winner? Who's the reject?
How did she answer?

Principal Cinch: Incorrect!
[camera shutter clicks]
Vice Principal Luna: That means the winner of the Friendship Games' first event is Twilight Sparkle and Crystal Prep!
Crystal Prep Students: [sigh, scattered applause]
Rainbow Dash: That was awesome!
Rarity: Truly amazing!
Sunset Shimmer: But we didn't win!
Applejack: That was as close to winnin' as Canterlot's ever been.
Dean Cadance: After a careful tally of the points, we'd like to present the students moving on to the Friendship Games' second event.
[applause]
The Main Six: [cheering]
Flash Sentry: Congratulations! You were really great!
[device humming]
Sci-Twi: I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Flash Sentry: Okay, then. Aw.
Cat: [purrs]
[bush rustling]
Fluttershy: Do you wanna give her a treat?
Sci-Twi: Guess I'm not the only one to smuggle her pet into school.
Fluttershy: [giggles] Not just one.
Sci-Twi: Oh, wow. All I have is Spike.
Puppy Spike: [panting]
Fluttershy: It really is uncanny. Does he talk?
Sci-Twi: Um, not that I know of.
Fluttershy: Congratulations on winning, by the way. Though, it didn't seem like anyone on your team was very excited about it.
Sci-Twi: No one at my school gets excited about anything they didn't do themselves.
Fluttershy: That sounds awful. [beat] Here. Hold this.
Sci-Twi: Um, why?
Fluttershy: Holding a bunny always makes me feel better.
Sci-Twi: Well, that's ridiculous. But... Ooh. It 
actually kind of works. I'm on the other team and you just lost. Why are
 you being so nice to me?
Fluttershy: You looked like you needed it.
[magic noises]
Sci-Twi: [gasps] Whoa!
[device activates]
Puppy Spike: [growls and barks]
Sci-Twi: Spike!
Puppy Spike: [yowls]
Sci-Twi: Spike!
Fluttershy: [shudders]
Sci-Twi: Spike, are you okay?
Puppy Spike: Um, I think so.
[beat]
Sci-Twi and Puppy Spike: Daaaah!!!
Sci-Twi: [squeals]
Puppy Spike: Twilight, wait!
Fluttershy: [sighs] Bye.
Sci-Twi: [panting]
Puppy Spike: Twilight, come on! Wait for me! [panting] Why did you run away like that?
Sci-Twi: Um, oh, I don't know. Maybe it has something to do with the glowing girl, or the hole in space. Or my talking dog!
Puppy Spike: Yeah. Weird, right?
Sci-Twi: Are you okay? How do you feel? What happened? Where did you go?
Puppy Spike: Hey, one question at a time! This is pretty new to me, too.
Sci-Twi: Sorry.
Puppy Spike: All I know is I chased that pointy rabbit 
through the glowy thing and then I was somewhere else. Next thing I 
knew, I was back in that nice girl's arms and I could talk! I don't 
really understand why I couldn't before. I mean, it's so easy.
Principal Cinch: Twilight.
Sci-Twi: Quick! Hide in here!
[locker closes]
Principal Cinch: Who are you talking to?
Sci-Twi: Um, myself. It's a nervous habit. Were you looking for me?
Principal Cinch: Indeed I was. Quite a coincidence that the CHS students moving on to the next event are the same nice girls who were so interested in you, don't you think?
Sci-Twi: I'm not sure.
Principal Cinch: Perhaps you should get to know them after all.
Sci-Twi: But I thought you didn't want me to.
Principal Cinch: Let's just say I'm covering my bases. 
Who knows? Perhaps they will reveal to you the secret to Canterlot 
High's newfound success.
Sci-Twi: I dunno. Spying feels kind of... wrong.
Principal Cinch: Well, it's your decision, Twilight. It's not as if your application hangs in the balance. On second thought, yes, it does.
Puppy Spike: Man, she's awful. What are you gonna do?
Sci-Twi: [sighs] I don't know, Spike. I don't know.
Fluttershy: All I did was hand Twilight a bunny. Then I ponied up.
Sunset Shimmer: I just don't get it. Rarity's magic came out when she made us outfits. Pinkie's when she fixed the party and now Fluttershy.
Fluttershy: And then Twilight's pendant thingy just pulled the magic right out of me. I couldn't even stand up.
Pinkie Pie: Like me at the party!
Rarity: Or me right before we met Twilight!
Sunset Shimmer: So she's stealing magic?
Applejack: I don't know. She doesn't seem like the magic-stealin' type.
Sunset Shimmer: Yeah, but she had something to do with closing the portal. If her pendant can pull in magic, maybe it stole the portal, too.
Fluttershy: How?
Sunset Shimmer: I don't know. And the pony or person or princess who could help me figure this out is completely unreachable now.
Pinkie Pie: Which is too bad, because Twilight knows everything about magic and portals and magical portals and portable magics!
[thud]
Rainbow Dash: For now, let's just focus on beating the 
Shadowbolts. And as long as this event puts me in a playing field, I 
don't think we've got anything to worry about.
Applejack: Oh, it puts you on a playin' field, alright.
Pinkie Pie: [gasps loudly]
Sunset Shimmer: Am I the only one who thinks this is overkill?
Applejack: [to Rarity] I don't suppose you made motocross outfits.
Rarity: Oh, don't be ridiculous. Of course I did!
Principal Cinch: You will race in pairs. Indigo Zap and Sugarcoat will handle the motocross.
Indigo Zap: Yes!
Principal Cinch: Lemon Zest and Sunny Flare have requested the short track.
Lemon Zest and Sunny Flare: [high five each other]
Principal Cinch: Since archery is a standard requirement
 at our school, any of you should be able to do it. Twilight and Sour 
Sweet will start us off.
Sour Sweet: [sweetly] Well, that's just marvelous! [sourly] If you wanna lose before we even start!
Principal Cinch: Given that Twilight won the last event 
single-handedly, I have every confidence that she will be able to pull 
her weight here. Won't you?
[camera shutter clicking]
Dean Cadance: Welcome, everyone to the Friendship Games Tricross Relay!
[crowd cheering]
Dean Cadance: In this event, our qualifying competitors will face off in archery, speed skating, and finally, motocross.
[engine revs]
Dean Cadance: So if the competitors are ready... [blows 
airhorn] Each competitor must hit a bullseye before their teammates can 
start the next leg of the relay.
[arrows hit]
[audience cheers]
Sour Sweet: [growls]
[audience cheers]
[arrow hits]
[arrow misses]
Sour Sweet: [growls]
Applejack: [breathes]
[arrow whooshes]
[arrow hits]
[bell dings]
[crowd cheers]
Dean Cadance: And Canterlot is off to an early lead!
[arrows keep missing]
Sour Sweet: [sourly] Well, that's just fantastic!
Fluttershy: I'm sure glad I don't go to Crystal Prep.
Applejack: You said it.
Pinkie Pie: Whee!
Dean Cadance: If CPA can't hit another bullseye soon, they'll be out of this race.
Sugarcoat: You're really bad at this!
Applejack: Ugh! I can't take anymore! Ya have to stop aimin' at the target.
Sour Sweet: [sweetly sarcastic] Oh, that makes perfect sense! Don't aim at the target! Thanks so much!
Applejack: Ya have to stop aimin' at where the target is an' aim at where the target's gonna be.
Sour Sweet: [sweetly sarcastic] Yeah! Definitely take advice from the person [sourly] you're competing against!
Applejack: Do you wanna hit the bullseye or not? Then trust me. Take a deep breath.
Sci-Twi: [deep breath]
Applejack: And let the arrow go... riiiiight.... now!
[arrow whooshing]
[arrow hits]
[crowd cheers]
[bell dings]
Puppy Spike: Yeah! That's my girl!
Applejack: See? I was tellin' ya the truth.
[magic noises]
[device hums]
Applejack: Eh... what... are... you... doing?!
Sci-Twi: I don't know!
[thud]
[whoosh]

Dean Cadance: Canterlot only has two laps to go! But it looks like Crystal Prep is making up for lost time!
[Shadowbolts fans cheering]
[wheels rolling]
Rarity: Come on!
[Wondercolts fans cheering]
Dean Cadance: What a finish!
[camera shutter clicks]
[engines rev]
Sci-Twi: Aah!
Rainbow Dash: Awesome!
[crowd cheering]
Everfree Forest creature: [roars]
[crowd gasps]
[tires screech]
Everfree Forest creature: [roars]
Sunset Shimmer: Dash, you saved me!
Rainbow Dash: I wasn't about to let my friend become plant food.
[magic noises]
[tires screech]
Rainbow Dash: We can still win this!
Everfree Forest creature: [roars]
[thud]
Dean Cadance: Canterlot wins!
[Wondercolts fans cheering]
Dean Cadance: Attention, students, please proceed to the gym.
[device humming]
[portals closing]
Applejack: Is everybody all right?
Rainbow Dash: Better than all right! We won!
Sunset Shimmer: Yeah, we won, but somebody could've been seriously hurt. The magic is going haywire and I have no idea how to fix it!
Sci-Twi: Um, excuse me, I didn't mean for any of this to
 happen. I just wanted to learn about the strange energy coming from 
your school. I didn't know that it was magic or... how it works.
Rainbow Dash: That's okay. Neither do we.
Sci-Twi: Oh, no! Oh, no no no! Not again!
Rainbow Dash: [struggling]
Sci-Twi: I'm sorry! It just started absorbing energy on its own! But I'm not sure how!
Sunset Shimmer: What do you mean you don't know how?!
[portal opening]
Sci-Twi: It also causes these corresponding rifts to appear! I don't know how that works either.
Sunset Shimmer: Is there anything you do know?! Like how to get our magic back?! Or how to fix the portal to Equestria?!
Sci-Twi: Equestria?
Sunset Shimmer: You're supposed to be so smart, but did you ever think that you shouldn't be messing around with things you don't understand?!
[portal closing]
Sci-Twi: But I wanna understand!
Sunset Shimmer: But you don't! And worst of all, you put the lives of my friends in danger!
Sci-Twi: [voice breaking] I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. [sobbing]
Puppy Spike: Twilight, wait!
Principal Celestia: [clears throat]
Principal Cinch: You can't possibly call that a fair race.
Principal Celestia: Principal Cinch, we all saw what happened. You can't think CHS had some kind of advantage.
Principal Cinch: Can't I? Even without your trained attack plants, your students have wings!
Principal Celestia: Well, the race certainly had some... extenuating circumstances. Perhaps we should end the games now and declare a tie.
Principal Cinch: A tie? Was this your strategy all 
along? To force us into accepting you as equals? I think not. The games 
will continue and Crystal Prep will prevail despite your antics and 
whatever performance-enhancing regimen your students are on.
Sunset Shimmer: I'm sorry I couldn't stop all this from happening.
Principal Celestia: It's not your fault, Sunset.
Sunset Shimmer: Isn't it? I should know how to control 
the magic I brought here. But I don't. I let everyone down. And now 
Principal Cinch thinks we're cheating.
Principal Celestia: It doesn't matter what Principal Cinch thinks.
Sunset Shimmer: But it does. The students here at CHS 
don't just wanna win. They wanna beat Crystal Prep. It isn't gonna count
 if the other side doesn't really think they lost. Crystal Prep is never
 gonna believe we won fair and square if there's magic around. And that 
magic is only around... because of me.
[crowd cheering]
Dean Cadance: Since the score's tied, the final event will determine the winner of the Friendship Games.
Vice Principal Luna: Somewhere on campus, a pennant from
 each school has been hidden. The first team to find their school's flag
 and bring it back wins.
Dean Cadance: And as soon as our teams are ready, we'll begin.
Fluttershy: I don't feel like playing these games anymore.
Rainbow Dash: But we have to play. This is the last event!
Rarity: [scoffs] It's a little hard to focus with all the magic stealing and portal opening.
Sunset Shimmer: And I feel awful about what I said to Twilight.
Fluttershy: Especially since she obviously didn't mean to do all the stuff she did. She's actually really nice.
Sunset Shimmer: [facepalms]
Applejack: Let's just get through this last event and prove we're not a bunch of cheaters. Then you can go over and apologize.
Principal Cinch: I know I'm asking you to beat a team 
that isn't playing fair, but Canterlot High must be made to understand 
that even with magic at their disposal, beating Crystal Prep is simply 
not an option.
Sugarcoat: What if they grow wings again?
Principal Cinch: A fair question. Though I believe we 
can now fight fire with fire. I've seen what your device can do, 
Twilight. Containing magical energy is fine, but have you considered 
releasing it?
Sci-Twi: But I don't even understand how it works.
Principal Cinch: But you'd like to. And since our 
opponents have already used it to stay competitive, I see no reason why 
we shouldn't do the same. Unless, of course, you have no interest
 in Everton. Though, honestly, I think there's more knowledge packed in 
that little device than any independent study program could offer.
[Principal Cinch]
I realize that you've always been an outcast
It's not everyone at school who likes to think
To find a student that's like you
I've had one or maybe two
But the good ones disappear before I blink

[Shadowbolts]
(Oh, wuh-oh-wuh, oh
Oh, wuh-oh-wuh)

[Principal Cinch]
Now, I understand you have your reservations (oh-wuh)
It's hard to have a brain as large as yours (oh-oh-oh-oh)
But if we don't win these games
Well, I think I've made it plain
What will happen if we have the losing scores!

[Shadowbolts]
(Oh, wuh-oh-wuh, oh
Oh, wuh-oh-wuh)

Unleash the magic, unleash the magic
If we lose, then you're to blame (ah, ah-ah-ah)
They all have used it, maybe abused it (ah-ah-ah)
So then why can't we do the same?

(Oh, wuh-oh-wuh, oh
Oh, wuh-oh-wuh)

[Principal Cinch]
Call it power, call it magic
If we lose, it will be tragic
More important is the knowledge we'll have lost (oh-oh-oh-oh)
A chance like this won't come again
You'll regret not giving in
Isn't understanding magic worth the cost?

[Shadowbolts]
(Oh, wuh-oh-wuh, oh
Oh, wuh-oh-wuh)

Unleash the magic, unleash the magic
We're not friends here after all
Our only interest in this business (ah-ah-ah)
Is seeing Canterlot High School fall

(Oh, wuh-oh-wuh, oh
Oh, wuh-oh-wuh, oh)

[Principal Cinch]
What I'm suggesting's very simple
And since it's win-win on all scores
You only want to learn about the
Magic that you have stored

And as for me and all the others
We only want what we deserve
That our school will clinch the win
And my...

[Principal Cinch and Shadowbolts]
...legacy will endure

Unleash the magic, unleash the magic
If we lose, then it's a crime
But we can win it if you begin it (ah-ah-ah)
It's up to you to not fail this time

[Male Shadowbolts]
Unleash the magic, free the magic now

[Female Shadowbolts]
Unleash the magic, free the magic now




[Sci-Twi]
Imagine all I'll learn by setting it free


Vice Principal Luna: If both teams are ready...


[Male Shadowbolts]
Unleash the magic, free the magic now


[Female Shadowbolts]
Unleash the magic, free the magic now





[Sci-Twi]
And now winning these games depends on me



[Male Shadowbolts]
Unleash the magic, free the magic now


[Female Shadowbolts]
Unleash the magic, free the magic now





And what doors might open if I try to use it


Dean Cadance: ...the last event of the Friendship Games begins...


[Male Shadowbolts]
Unleash the magic, free the magic now


[Female Shadowbolts]
Unleash the magic, free the magic now





[Sci-Twi]
But the magic's what I really want to see


Puppy Spike: Twilight, no!


[Male Shadowbolts]
Unleash the magic, free the magic now


[Shadowbolts]
Unleash the magic, free the magic...
Unleash the magic, free the magic...


[All]
Now!

[boom, whoosh]
Puppy Spike: [gasps]
Sci-Twi: [struggles] Heeeeeeeeeelllllllp... meeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Uhh! Ahh!
[transformation noises]
Puppy Spike: [whimpers]
Midnight Sparkle: [evil laughter] [to Sunset] You were right! I didn't understand magic before, but I do now!
[explosion]
Sunset Shimmer: Equestria!
[crackling]
[students screaming]
Sunny Flare: Hey! Where are you going?!
Principal Cinch: Anywhere to avoid that... monster! And I suggest you do the same!
Sunset Shimmer: Twilight, you can't do this!
Midnight Sparkle: Why not?! There's a whole other world right there, and it's just filled with magic!
Sunset Shimmer: But you're destroying this world to get it!
Midnight Sparkle: So what? There's more magic there, and I want to understand it all!
[explosion]
[students screaming]
Sunset Shimmer: Uhh!
Applejack: [grunts] Don't let go!
[students screaming]
Rainbow Dash: Hang on!
Rarity: Obviously! [struggling]
Indigo Zap: We got you!
[device humming]
[magic noises]
Sunset Shimmer: This isn't the way! I know you feel 
powerful right now, like you can have everything you want! I've been 
where you are, I've made the same mistake you're making! I put on a 
crown and, just like you, I was overwhelmed by the magic it contained! I
 thought it could get me everything I wanted!
Midnight Sparkle: Oh, you're wrong. Unlike you, I can have everything I want!
Sunset Shimmer: No, you can't. Even with all that magic 
and power, you'll still be alone! True magic comes from honesty! 
Loyalty! Laughter! Generosity! Kindness! I understand you, Twilight, and
 I want to show you the most important magic of all...
[transformation noises]
Daydream Shimmer: ...the Magic of Friendship!
[magic noises]
Midnight Sparkle: [grunts] [evil laughter]
Puppy Spike: Twilight!
Sci-Twi: Spike?
Midnight Sparkle: Noooo!
Daydream Shimmer: Take my hand, Twilight. Let me show you there's another way... just like someone once did for me.
[magic noises]
Sci-Twi: I am so sorry... I didn't mean for any of this to happen...
Sunset Shimmer: I know. And going by my own experiences, they'll forgive you.
Puppy Spike: [barks]
Sci-Twi: [giggles]
Principal Cinch: [angrily] Principal Celestia, on behalf 
of Crystal Prep, I demand that you forfeit the Friendship Games! 
Clearly, CHS has had unfair advantage for quite some time! And it's 
certainly obvious that your students have been using magic for their own
 benefit!
Principal Celestia: I'd like to think that saving the world benefits us all.
Sugarcoat: At least they didn't manipulate Twilight into
 releasing all the stolen magic and turning into a power-crazed magical 
creature that tried to rip the world apart just to win a game.
Pinkie Pie: Wow! That's a lot to take in when you say it all at once.
Principal Cinch: That's ridiculous!
Puppy Spike: Nope, that's pretty much what happened.
Sour Sweet: [sweetly] Actually, we're all to blame. [sourly] Mostly it was her.
Principal Cinch: Obviously my students have been infected with your magic, but I plan on taking all of this up with the school board!
Principal Celestia: Good. I'm sure they would be very interested in hearing all about the magical students with wings.
Vice Principal Luna: Oh, and the portals to different dimensions.
Dean Cadance: And don't forget to tell them about the talking dog. [giggles]
Puppy Spike: Because that would never ruin your reputation.
[Princess Twilight's theme playing]
Principal Celestia: Well, I know these Friendship Games 
haven't been what any of us expected, but given what we've all just been
 through, I think it's fair to declare us all winners.
[everyone cheers]
Dean Cadance: I guess that was one way to finish up your time at Crystal Prep. Pretty sure Cinch will be fast-tracking your application after all of that.
Sci-Twi: I've been thinking about it and... I'm not so sure now is the time for me to apply to Everton.
Dean Cadance: Really?
Sci-Twi: I may know about a lot of things, but 
friendship isn't really one of them. And I'm definitely not gonna learn 
more about it by being alone all the time.
Dean Cadance: So, you're staying at Crystal Prep?
Sci-Twi: Well, it seems the students here at CHS know an awful lot about the subject. I don't suppose...
Dean Cadance: You could transfer to this school instead.
Sci-Twi: Really?
Dean Cadance: You'd certainly be missed at Crystal Prep.
 But I think that's a great idea! I'll be sure to speak to Principal 
Celestia about it right away.
Fluttershy: Still no word from Princess Twilight?
Sunset Shimmer: Not yet. But I think I may have figured 
out how magic works in this world. We pony up when we're showing the 
truest part of ourselves. I was so busy waiting for someone else to give
 me the answers that I gave up looking for them myself. I'm sure there 
will be more magical problems that pop up in this world, but like 
Applejack said, Princess Twilight has her own problems to worry about in
 Equestria. We can't expect her to always be around to help us.
Sci-Twi: But maybe I can be?
Principal Celestia: It seems we have a new Wondercolt here at Canterlot High!
Sci-Twi: I'm not sure how much help I could be. But I'd like to try. If you would all give me a chance.
Principal Celestia: I'm sure I can count on you girls to help her feel at home.
Sunset Shimmer: You sure can.
Pinkie Pie: [squee]
Twilight Sparkle: I'm so sorry I didn't get here sooner! I
 didn't get your messages until just now because I was caught in this 
time travel loop and, honestly, it was the strangest thing that's ever 
happened to me! [beat]
Pinkie Pie: [slurping drink]
Twilight Sparkle: Make that the second strangest.
[end credits]
[Sci-Twi]
I spent so much time searchin'
Lookin' for somethin' more
Diggin' holes too deep
And opening every door

And when you stand too close
Yeah, the picture's never clear
And when you look too far away
It all but disappears

[All]
And it was right (right) there in front of me (Oh-oh, ah-oh-oh)
Just too close for me to see (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Sometimes the things you want
Are not the things you need
And it was right there in front of me

[Sunset Shimmer]
There was a time before
I didn't know where I belonged
I thought I needed more
And that I couldn't get along

[Sci-Twi and Sunset Shimmer]
But who I am
Was all I ever needed
And when I faced that test
I finally succeeded

[All]
And it was right (right) there in front of me (Oh-oh, ah-oh-oh)
Just too close for me to see (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Sometimes the things you want
Are not the things you need
And it was right there in front of me

Oh, whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh

[Sci-Twi and Sunset Shimmer]
And it's all I'll ever need

[All]
Oh, whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh

[Sci-Twi and Sunset Shimmer]
And it was right there in front of me

And it's all I'll ever need

[All]
Oh, whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh

And it was right there in front of me-ee-ee
