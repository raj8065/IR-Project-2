[patrons arguing]
Female Patron: What?!
The Dazzlings: [vocalizing]
Aria Blaze: [sighs] That was barely worth the effort, Adagio. I'm tired of fast food. I need a meal.
Adagio Dazzle: The energy in this world isn't the same as in Equestria. We can only gain so much power here.
Aria Blaze: Ugh! I wish we'd never been banished to this awful place!
Adagio Dazzle: [sarcastically] Really? I love it here!
Sonata Dusk: For realsies? Because I think this place is the worst.
Aria Blaze: I think you're the worst, Sonata.
Sonata Dusk: Oh, yeah? Well, I think you're—
Adagio Dazzle: Ergh! I'll tell you one thing, being stuck here with you two isn't making this world any more [through clenched teeth] bearable.
[sonic rainboom]
Adagio Dazzle: [gasp] Did you feel that?! Do you know what that is?
Sonata Dusk and Aria Blaze: I 'unno.
Adagio Dazzle: It's Equestrian magic!
Aria Blaze: But this world doesn't have Equestrian magic.
Adagio Dazzle: It does now. And we're going to use it to make everyone in this pathetic little world adore us!
[The Rainbooms]
We used to fight with each other
(Oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh)
That was before we discovered
(Oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh)
That when your friendship is real
(Oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh)
Yeah, you just say what ya feel

And the music, yeah, the music
Gets us to the top
As we learn how the rainbow...
Rainbow Rocks!

[Applejack]
You can pick up the bass

[The Rainbooms]
(Oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh)

[Rainbow Dash]
And you can play the guitar

[The Rainbooms]
(Oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh)

[Pinkie Pie]
You can bang on the drums

[The Rainbooms]
(Oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh)

[Twilight Sparkle]
Or you can sing like a star

[The Rainbooms]
And the music, yeah, the music
Gets us to the top
As we learn how the rainbow...
Rainbow Rocks!

As we learn how the rainbow...
Rainbow Rocks!

[students chattering]
Sunset Shimmer: Want some help?
Apple Bloom: Uh, no thanks. We're good.
Sunset Shimmer: Oh. Okay.
Pinkie Pie: Sunset Shimmer! Over here!
[students whispering]
Sunset Shimmer: [sighs] I had no idea the whole school would be here.
Rarity: Quite the eye-catching advertisement, if I do say so myself.
Pinkie Pie: And it smells like cake!
Fluttershy: It does? [sniff, sniff]
Pinkie Pie: I used frosting instead of paste!
Applejack: Uh, Fluttershy, you've got a little somethin', uh...
Fluttershy: Did I get it?
Applejack: Heh, not exactly.
Principal Celestia: Good afternoon, students. I just 
wanted to tell you all how pleased I am that so many of you are going to
 participate in the first ever Canterlot High School Musical Showcase!
[students cheer]
Principal Celestia: This is a wonderful opportunity to 
raise money for all our after-school programs here at CHS. So keep 
working on those signs and posters. I think it's going to be one of the 
most exciting events we've had at CHS since the Fall Formal.
Sunset Shimmer: Ugh! I am never gonna live that down.
Fluttershy: You were pretty bad at the Fall Formal.
Sunset Shimmer: A demon. I turned into a raging she-demon.
Pinkie Pie: And tried to turn everyone here into teenage zombies for your own personal army!
Rarity: Oh, darling, you have us, and we've forgiven you for your past... ahem... booboos.
Applejack: To be honest, I'd say the whole experience brought everyone at Canterlot High closer than ever before!
Pinkie Pie: One, two, three!
[The Rainbooms]
There was a time we were apart
But that's behind us now
See how we've made a brand new start
And the future's lookin' up, ah-oh, ah-oh
And when you walk these halls
You feel it everywhere
Yeah, we're the Wondercolts forever, ah-oh, yeah!

We are all together
(Ah, ah, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now it's better than ever
(Ah, ah, oh-oh-oh-oh)
You can feel it, we are back (You... can... feel... it...)
And I'm so glad that we're better
Better than ever
Whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh
Oh yeah, we're better than ever
Whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh

[Rainbow Dash]
There was a time we couldn't see
Past the differences

[Applejack]
That separated you and me
And it left us on our own

[Pinkie Pie]
But now you walk these halls
And friends are everywhere

[The Rainbooms]
Yeah, we're the Wondercolts forever, ah-oh, yeah!

We are all together
(Ah, ah, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now it's better than ever
(Ah, ah, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now that we are back on track (Now... that... we... are...)
Yes, I'm so glad that we're better
Better than ever

Whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh
Oh yeah, we're better than ever
Whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh
Oh yeah, we're better than ever
Whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh
Oh yeah, we're better than ever!

Sunset Shimmer: [applauds]
Rarity: [laughs] I still can't believe that happens when
 we play! Ooh! I've got to look into some new accessories! Something 
that looks good in a longer ponytail. Ooh! Maybe some clip-on earrings 
for when I get those adorable pony ears.
Applejack: I just wonder why it happens. Princess Twilight took her crown back to Equestria. Shouldn't that mean she took all the magic back with her?
Rainbow Dash: Who cares why it happens? It makes my band totally awesome!
Rarity: Oh! Your band?
Rainbow Dash: Duh! It was my idea to start the Rainbooms so we could be in the showcase. Plus I'm the lead singer and guitarist.
[knock on door]
Flash Sentry: Uh, heard you outside. You guys are sounding really tight.
Rainbow Dash: Uh, we're getting there. Rarity's still 
coming in a little late on the second verse, and Applejack's bass solo 
could use a little work. They'll get it together in time for the 
showcase.
Flash Sentry: Uh, I don't suppose any of our friends from, uh... out of town might come? Uh, it being a special charity event and all.
Applejack: Sorry, Flash. I don't think Twilight's gonna be back at Canterlot High any time soon.
Flash Sentry: [laughs nervously] Oh, yeah. Okay. I just, you know, thought I'd ask. Uh, k-keep on rockin' it.
[thud]
Rarity: Well. [giggles] Someone is quite the smitten 
kitten. [to Sunset Shimmer] Oh. Sorry. I always forget you and Flash 
used to be an item.
Sunset Shimmer: It's okay. Flash is a great guy and all, but I never really liked-him liked him. I was just using him to become more popular. Ugh! The old me really was just awful, wasn't she?
Rarity: Mmm... horrid.
Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Fluttershy: Mm-hmm, uhhh, etc.
Pinkie Pie: Yep!
Applejack: But the important thing is that you've turned yourself around.
Sunset Shimmer: Thanks, Applejack, but I'm not sure everyone else at CHS feels the same way.
[P.A. system beeps]
Vice Principal Luna: Sunset Shimmer, please report to the main foyer.
Sunset Shimmer: Gotta run. I volunteered to show some 
new students around the school. Thought it'd be good for them to get to 
know the new me before they heard all the stuff about the old me.
Rainbow Dash: We've still got a few minutes before lunch starts. What do you say we do "Awesome As I Wanna Be"?
Fluttershy: Um, Rainbow Dash? I was wondering if we could maybe play the song I wrote?
Rainbow Dash: We'll get to it.
Fluttershy: Oh. Okay.
Rainbow Dash: [plays chord]
Sunset Shimmer: Hi. Are you the girls I'm supposed to show around?
Adagio Dazzle: We are.
Sunset Shimmer: Canterlot High is a great school. You're really gonna love it.
Adagio Dazzle: Oh, yes, we really sense there's something... magical about this place.
Sunset Shimmer: That's the science lab. Computer lab is 
in there. Oh! We're having a big musical showcase this weekend! The 
whole school is pretty much rallying around it.
Adagio Dazzle: [gasps] A musical showcase?
Sunset Shimmer: I'm sure since you're new, Principal Celestia would let you sign up if you're interested.
Aria Blaze: We have been known to sing from time to time.
Sonata Dusk: Hello? We sing, like, all the time! It's how we get people to do what we want.
Adagio Dazzle: [growls]
Sonata Dusk: Wha-What did I say?
Adagio Dazzle: What you meant to say was that being in a musical showcase sounds like a great way to meet other students.
Sonata Dusk: Ohhhh, yeah. Th-What she said I meant to say. That's what I meant. To say.
Aria Blaze: [scoffs] And what you would have said if you weren't the worst.
Sonata Dusk: You are!
Adagio Dazzle: You'll have to excuse them. They're idiots.
Aria Blaze and Sonata Dusk: Hmph.
[beat]
Sunset Shimmer: [nervous laugh] Those are pretty. Where did you—
Adagio Dazzle: [laughs] Sorry. These pendants mean an awful lot to us. We'd just hate for anything to happen to them.
[students chattering]
Applejack: So how was the tour?
Sunset Shimmer: I don't know. I mean, these girls, they were... There was something off about them.
Pinkie Pie: Like, off like this? Or off like this? Or... Oh, oh! Like—
Rainbow Dash: Maybe we should just let her tell us.
Sunset Shimmer: That's just it. I can't put my finger on
 it. They just acted sort of... strange around me. Maybe someone already
 talked to them. Told them about what I did. [sighs] So much for making a
 good first impression.
Fluttershy: Uh-huh. Oh, that's probably not it.
Adagio Dazzle: This is it, girls. The moment we've been waiting for.
Sonata Dusk: Lunch?!
Adagio Dazzle: [groan] The chance to get our true Equestrian magic back.
Sonata Dusk: Oh. Right.
Adagio Dazzle: Our voices are just strong enough to make them want something so badly, they'll fight to get it.
Aria Blaze: So we're just gonna do what we always do? 
Stir up some trouble and then feed off the negative energy? 
[sarcastically] Some plan, Adagio.
Adagio Dazzle: It won't be the same as the times before!
 There is Equestrian magic here. Their negative energy will give us the 
power we need to get this entire world to do our bidding.
Sonata Dusk: But we can get lunch after though, right? It's Taco Tuesday!
Adagio Dazzle: Just follow my lead.
Aria Blaze: Or my lead.
Adagio Dazzle: My lead!
[The Dazzlings]
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ahh
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ahh
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ahh
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ahh

[Adagio Dazzle]
We heard you want to get together
We heard you want to rock this school
We've thought of something that is better
Something that changes all the rules

Why pretend we're all the same
When some of us shine brighter?

[Aria Blaze and Sonata Dusk]
Shine brighter

[Adagio Dazzle]
Here's a chance to find your flame
Are you a loser or a fighter?

[The Dazzlings]
Me and you, you and me
Why don't we see who is better?
We don't have to be one and the same thing
Oh, what's so wrong with a little competition?
Are you afraid of failing the audition?

[Adagio Dazzle]
You're a star and you should know it
Yeah, you rise above the rest
It doesn't matter who you hurt
If you're just proving you're the best

[The Dazzlings]
Ah, ahh-ahh-ahhh

Battle! You wanna win it
Let's have a battle, battle of the bands
Let's have a battle, we'll go all in it
Let's have a battle, battle, battle
Battle of the bands

[The Dazzlings and students]
Battle!

"Blueberry Cake": I can beat you!
The Dazzlings and students: Battle!
"Cherry Crash": Ha! You wish!
The Dazzlings and students: Battle!
Trixie Lulamoon: I so want this!
The Dazzlings and students: Battle!
"Captain Planet": Not if I get it first!
[The Dazzlings and students]
Me and you, you and me
Why don't we see who is better?
We don't have to be one and the same thing
Oh, what's so wrong with a little competition?

[Students]
I'm going out and winning the audition

[The Dazzlings and students]
Battle! We wanna win it
Let's have a battle, battle of the bands
Let's have a battle, we'll go all in it
Let's have a battle, battle, battle
Battle of the bands!

[students arguing]
Pinkie Pie: Ohhhh. They're that kind of "off".
Sunset Shimmer: Those three are definitely in possession of some kind of dark magic. How else could you explain what happened back there?
Applejack: Don't worry, y'all. We'll let Principal 
Celestia know all about this and those girls will be kicked to the curb 
in no time. Last thing she needs is another CHS event almost ruined by 
some power-crazed lunatic. [to Sunset] Er, no offense.
Sunset Shimmer: [sighs] None taken.
Principal Celestia: Dark magic? I find that very hard to believe. Those girls came into my office earlier and were absolutely delightful.
Vice Principal Luna: Ugh! Perhaps Sunset Shimmer is just
 eager to make someone else out to be a bad element, so that her actions
 at the Fall Formal will become old news.
Sunset Shimmer: I could see why you might think that, but—
Rainbow Dash: That's not what's happening! We saw all of this go down in the cafeteria too!
Principal Celestia: Yes, but isn't your band supposed to be part of the Musical Showcase?
Rainbow Dash: Yes.
Vice Principal Luna: Perhaps you're all just worried that the Dazzlings will steal your spotlight.
Applejack: The "Dazzlings"?
Principal Celestia: It's the name of their musical 
group. That's why they came by my office earlier – to sign up for the 
Showcase. Even sang a little song to Vice Principal Luna and I.
Applejack: They did?
Principal Celestia: Yes. And we think having a Battle of the Bands instead is a marvelous idea.
Fluttershy: I can't believe they got to Principal Celestia and Vice Principal Luna too.
Rainbow Dash: They've gotten to everybody.
Pinkie Pie: Not everybody!
Applejack: Pinkie Pie's right. We were there when the 
Dazzlings were singin' and we weren't affected. It was like we were 
protected somehow.
Rainbow Dash: So let's take them down! It's not like we 
haven't tangled with dark magic before and totally whooped its sorry 
butt! Uh, no offense.
Sunset Shimmer: [sighs] None taken. Again.
Fluttershy: But that was when Twilight was here. There 
may be some kind of magic inside us, but it only comes out when we play 
music. I sure don't know how to use it to... whoop anybody's butt.
Rarity: [sighs] If only we could get a message to 
Twilight. Maybe she could tell us how to break the spell the Dazzlings 
have cast on our friends.
Rainbow Dash: Well, that's not gonna happen. The portal's closed.
Rarity: [gasps] [gasps again]
Rainbow Dash: And I get the feeling they don't exactly have cell phones where she's from.
Sunset Shimmer: I may have an idea how we can get in touch with Princess Twilight!
[rustling]
Sunset Shimmer: When I was Princess Celestia's student 
back in Equestria, she gave me this. Even after I abandoned my studies, I
 held onto it. Deep down, I guess I knew I was making a big mistake, and
 I wanted to still have a way to reach out to her. Maybe it still works.
Rarity: That's a book, darling. What do you mean, "maybe still works"?
Sunset Shimmer: It used to be that if I wrote something 
here, it would appear in the pages of a book back in Princess Celestia's
 library. I get a message to her, then she can get a message to Princess Twilight.
Rainbow Dash: So what are you waiting for? Get to writing!
Sunset Shimmer: [sighs] Been a long time since I've written these words. "Dear Princess Celestia..."
Delivery Pony: Excuse me, Princess. Where do you want all these books from Princess Celestia?
Twilight Sparkle: The library. Third door on the left.
Delivery Pony: Even this one that's glowin' and vibratin'?
[buzzing]
[pages flipping]
Fluttershy: What is it, Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle: It looks like a message to Princess Celestia from my friends at Canterlot High.
Rarity: How is that even possible?
Twilight Sparkle: I have no idea, but it... sounds like they need my help.
Twilight Sparkle: The way Sunset Shimmer described them, I think these new girls sound an awful lot like... the sirens.
Pinkie Pie: Not the sirens! [whispering loudly to Fluttershy] I don't actually know what that is!
Twilight Sparkle: The sirens were three beautiful but 
dangerous creatures who had the power to charm ponies with their music. 
But to maintain this power, they had to feed on the negativity and 
distrust of others. The more of this negative energy they consumed, the 
stronger their voices became, and the farther they could spread their 
dark magic.
Fluttershy: I don't think I like this story very much.
Twilight Sparkle: If the sirens had their way, they 
would have divided and conquered all of Equestria. But a certain Star 
Swirl the Bearded wasn't having it. Rumor has it he found a way to 
banish them to another world – one where he believed their magic power 
would be lost. That world must have been the one where my Canterlot High
 friends live.
Applejack: But Star Swirl must have sent them there ages ago. How come they're just surfacin' now?
Twilight Sparkle: I don't know. But if my hunch is right and it is
 the sirens who have come to Canterlot High, this spell they've cast is 
just the beginning. My friends need me. I have to get back to them.
Rainbow Dash: I hate to burst your bubble, Twilight, but
 the connection between their world and Equestria will still be totally 
cut off for a super long time.
Pinkie Pie: Okay, first of all, if there was 
bubble-blowing going on, why wasn't I told about it?! And secondly, if 
the connection is totally cut off, how was Sunset Shimmer able to get a 
message to Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] Pinkie, you're a genius!
Pinkie Pie: Yeah, I get that a lot. [to Rainbow Dash] Now about those bubbles...
[handiwork noises]
Twilight Sparkle: ...And the interval between the two 
points is defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of the 
separation between the points along three spatial dimensions.
Spike: Say what now?
Pinkie Pie: Duh! She's gonna take the magic in here and 
put it in there. That'll make the portal open up so that whenever she 
wants to, she can go from here to there. There to here. Here to there. 
Here there! Here there! Here—
Applejack: We get the idea!
Twilight Sparkle: Now to see if it actually works.
[magic noises]
Main cast: Ooooh...
[electricity crackling]
Main cast: Ahhhhh...
Applejack: Don't suppose we could join you this time around?
Twilight Sparkle: Better not. It could make things pretty confusing if Canterlot High all of a sudden had two of all of you.
Rest of main cast: [agreeing]
Spike: But I still get to go, right? There isn't another one of me at Canterlot High. And you never know if you might need your trusty assistant.
Twilight Sparkle: Mm-hmm.
Spike: Yes!
Twilight Sparkle: We won't be gone long.



Fluttershy:
Oh, you be careful, Twilight.


Rainbow Dash:
Take care!


Applejack:
Y'all be safe now.

Rarity: And don't forget to dress well.
Pinkie Pie: [squee]
Twilight Sparkle: Ready, Spike?
Spike: [cracks knuckles] [blows] [squeaks claws] Ready!
Rainbow Dash: [sighs] I'm starting to think she's not coming.
Sunset Shimmer, Applejack, Rarity, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Pinkie Pie: Twilight!
Twilight Sparkle: Oof. I'm back.
Rest of main cast: [greeting Twilight]
Twilight Sparkle: And I've got some bad news about those new girls.
Rest of main cast: [worried reaction]
Rarity: Oh, I do hate that you had to return at a time of crisis. There's so much catching up to do!
Applejack: For starters, a certain blue-haired guitar player was just askin' about you.
Twilight Sparkle: [excitedly] Flash Sentry was asking about me?! [clears throat] Isn't that nice? [sips milkshake]
Rarity: Perhaps you would give us just the slightest bit of gossip from your world?
Spike: She's got an official title now. [imitates fanfare] The Princess of Friendship!
Sunset Shimmer: Wow, that's really impressive. Guess you really were Princess Celestia's prized pupil.
Spike: She's even got her own castle!
Rarity: A castle?! You have your own castle?!? Eh... [clears throat] Ooh, uh, lovely.
Twilight Sparkle: What's new here? I mean, besides your school becoming the target of dangerous magical creatures from Equestria?
Rainbow Dash: Yeah, so, that isn't exactly the only strange thing that's happened since you left. Pretty sweet, huh? It happens to all of us when we play.
Twilight Sparkle: Hmm. My crown was returned to 
Equestria, but some of its magic must have remained here at Canterlot 
High. Now that we're all back together, we can use that magic on the 
sirens. Just like when we were able to use it on Sunset Shimmer when she
 turned into that horrifyingly awful winged monster! No offense.
Sunset Shimmer: [disgruntled] None taken. Heh. I'm used to it.
Rainbow Dash: They'll never even know what hit 'em! [karate yells]
Applejack: We've got nothin' to worry about now that Twilight's back.
Fluttershy: Oh, I'm pretty sure I could find something to worry about. But it won't be the sirens.
Twilight Sparkle: The sooner we do this, the better. Any idea where the Dazzlings might be?
Pinkie Pie: [sips milkshake] [sighs] There's a big party
 tonight for all the bands who signed up to be in the showcase! That 
would include the Dazzlings.
Twilight Sparkle: Looks like we've got a party to crash.
Pinkie Pie: [squee]
[students arguing]
Flash Sentry: [sighs] I'm gonna get more punch!
[crash!]
Flash Sentry: Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle: Eh, bumped, into, always, doing?
Flash Sentry: What are you doing here? You came back for the big competition, right?
Twilight Sparkle: Something like that.
Flash Sentry: Huh. Not that there's gonna be any real competition. No one here wants this as bad as my band does!
Twilight Sparkle: Can you excuse me for just a minute?
[students' arguing becomes louder]
Adagio Dazzle: [mock surprise] Oh, no! No one's 
mingling! It's like there's some kind of underlying tension that could 
bubble to the surface at any minute!
Sonata Dusk: It's the fruit punch, isn't it? I knew I used too much grape juice!
Adagio Dazzle: It's not the fruit punch! It's us!
Aria Blaze: But the punch is awful, too.
Sonata Dusk: What do you know about good fruit punch?
Aria Blaze: More than you!
Sonata Dusk: Do not!
Aria Blaze: Do too!
Adagio Dazzle: This is just the kickoff party, girls. Imagine what a tizzy they'll be in by the time the Battle of the Bands starts.
Twilight Sparkle: There isn't going to be a Battle of 
the Bands! We're gonna make sure of that! Alright, girls, let's do this!
 Friendship is magic!
[awkward silence]
[someone coughs]
Rainbow Dash: Uh, weren't there rainbows and lasers and stuff last time?
Twilight Sparkle: I don't understand. We're all together again. Why isn't this working?
Spike: You, uh... really need to go ahead and do that whole "magic of friendship" thing now.
Twilight Sparkle: I'm trying, Spike. I thought the six 
of us standing together against the sirens would bring out the magic we 
needed to defeat them. That's what happened before.
Adagio Dazzle: Talk about throwing down the gauntlet! 
This group is obviously serious about winning! A little cocky though, 
aren't they? Claiming there won't really be a battle. Seems they think 
they've already got this thing all locked up.
Trixie Lulamoon: Not if the Great and Powerful Trrrrrixie has anything to do with it!
Flash Sentry: Whatever, Trixie! We're the best band at CHS!
Apple Bloom: No! The Crusaders are gonna win!
[students arguing even louder]
Adagio Dazzle: I think we may have found what we're looking for. Or rather, it found us.
Aria Blaze: [slaps herself]
Adagio Dazzle: Magic!! Don't you see?! Everyone else has fallen under our spell. But not these girls. These girls are special.
Twilight Sparkle: It doesn't make any sense. I should 
have been able to create the spark that would help us break their spell.
 That's how it worked before.
Sunset Shimmer: But to defeat me, you drew magic from the crown I was wearing. The sirens' magic comes from their music. So maybe you have to use the same kind of magic to defeat them. Or... maybe not.
Twilight Sparkle: No. I think you're onto something.
Sunset Shimmer: Really?
Twilight Sparkle: It's when you play music that you transform now, right?
Applejack: Yup. Ears, tails, the whole shebang.
Twilight Sparkle: So maybe the way to use that magic to defeat the sirens is by playing a musical counter-spell!
Fluttershy: You mean like a song?
Twilight Sparkle: Uh-huh. And in order to free everyone who's been exposed to the sirens' spell, we'll need them all to hear it.
Rest of main cast: Hmmm...
Rarity: [gasps] The band competition! That's the next time we can be certain everyone will be in the same place at the same time.
Applejack: Guess the Rainbooms are the band to beat.
Rarity: And I believe you, Twilight, just became the Rainbooms' newest member.
Rest of main cast: [laughing and cheering]
Pinkie Pie: So what do you wanna play? Triangle? [ding] Sousaphone? [fwomp!] Theremin? [plays theremin] Soooo magical.
Twilight Sparkle: I might take a little too long to learn how to play something with these. I'll just sing.
Rainbow Dash: Like, as in, lead singer? Cuz that's usually my gig. This being my band and all.
Applejack: It's our band! And, of course, as lead singer. She's the one with the magical know-how to help us pull this thing off.
Rainbow Dash: Okay, yeah, that's cool. I'll just use this as a chance to hone my already insanely good lead guitar skills.
Twilight Sparkle: It's only temporary. And we don't have
 to win the Battle of the Bands. We just have to perform during the 
first round of the competition.
Rainbow Dash: Let's get to learning that musical counter-spell!
Twilight Sparkle: Well, that's just it. I don't know any.
Rest of main cast: Awww...
Twilight Sparkle: But I'm sure I could figure out how to write one.
Spike: Totally! Twilight can write a spell like it's nobody's business. That's pretty much how she got to become a princess in Equestria.
Twilight Sparkle: Technically, I helped finish a spell. And there was a little more to it than that, Spike.
Spike: Yeah, whatever.
Twilight Sparkle: I've got this. [to Spike] C'mon!
Applejack: Where're you goin'?
Twilight Sparkle: Well, last time we were here, Spike and I spent the night in the library.
Pinkie Pie: Are you crazy?! We're besties now! Slumber party at my house!
[video game noises]
Pinkie Pie: Status update: "Okie-dokie-lokie."
[smartphone camera snaps]
[video game noises continue]
Rainbow Dash: [slams console]
Applejack: Hey! I was about to beat you!
Rainbow Dash: I doubt it. So, Twilight, how is that counter-spell comin'?
Twilight Sparkle: Huh? Oh, uh, good. Great. Thanks for 
letting me use your notebook, Fluttershy. I really like the song you 
wrote for the Rainbooms.
Fluttershy: Thanks. [sighs] Hopefully one day, we'll get a chance to play it.
Rainbow Dash: [laughing]
Applejack: Hey!
Rarity: Twilight, I think I speak for all of us when I say I don't know what we would have done if you hadn't come back to help us.
Rest of main cast: Uh-huh.
Applejack: Darn tootin'.
[doorbell rings]
Pinkie Pie: Pizza's here!
[zip!]
Twilight Sparkle: [sighs]
Pinkie Pie: Don't you want any pizza?
[drawer opens]
[drawer closes]
Rest of main cast: [snoring]
[drawer opens]
Twilight Sparkle: [spits] No. That's not gonna work.
Sunset Shimmer: Hey, Twilight. You're up late.
Twilight Sparkle: Just looking over the counter-spell. We only get one shot at this. It has to be perfect.
Sunset Shimmer: We really are lucky you're here.
Twilight Sparkle: That's what everyone keeps telling me.
Sunset Shimmer: Who could possibly need this much 
whipped cream? Must be nice to have everyone always looking to you for 
answers to their problems... instead of waiting for you to cause a problem.
Twilight Sparkle: Just because everyone expects something from you doesn't mean it's guaranteed to happen.
Sunset Shimmer: Well, that doesn't stop them from expecting it.
Twilight Sparkle: Which only makes things harder because the last thing you want to do is...
Twilight Sparkle and Sunset Shimmer: ...let everybody down.
Sunset Shimmer: Waaah!
Maud: Boulder was hungry.
Sunset Shimmer: I still can't get over the fact that she's related to Pinkie Pie.
Twilight Sparkle: You and me both!
Sunset Shimmer: [yawns] I better get some sleep. Good 
luck with the counter-spell. Not that you'll need it. This must be 
nothing compared with the stuff you're expected to deal with as a 
princess in Equestria.
Twilight Sparkle: Sunset Shimmer? ...Never mind. It's not important. No, I have to be able to do this. I have to.

[Twilight Sparkle]
[singing slightly off-key]
Hey, hey, listen
[feedback]
We've got a message for you
We're not all alike
But our friendship is true

Yeah, we're really different
But we still get along
So hey, hey, listen to our song

You may think you're in control
But we're here to prove you wrong
With our friendship and our music
With the power of our song

Gonna stomp our feet, clap our hands
With the magic of friendship
Gonna stop your evil plan

Spike: Eh, that sounded... way better than the last... five times you've played it. Heh heh.
Big McIntosh: Nnope.
Spike: [whimpers]
Rainbow Dash: I think it's pretty obvious what's going wrong with this counter-spell.
Applejack: You're turnin' what should be the chorus into a five-minute guitar solo?
Rainbow Dash: I have to pick up the slack somehow! Are you guys even trying?!
Fluttershy: I'm trying.
Twilight Sparkle: It's fine. [nervous laugh] It'll be fine. One more time from the top!
Rarity: Or, perhaps we could take a short break, try on 
some of the wardrobe choices I've put together? I'm particularly fond of
 this one. Eh, of course we could always go with something a bit more 
modern.
Applejack: We're tryin' to save our school here. Enough with the costumes!
Rarity: [robotic voice] Oh, you can never have enough costumes!
Pinkie Pie: She just wants to make things fun! Isn't that what being in a band supposed to be? [plays rimshot angrily]
Sunset Shimmer: You don't have time for any of this! You're supposed to check in at the Battle of the Bands in fifteen minutes!
Main cast: [gasps] Oh, no!
Twilight Sparkle: What? But it's not ready! If we play 
our counter-spell in the first round and it doesn't work, the sirens 
will know what we're up to and make sure we don't get a chance to play 
it again!
[screeeeeech!]
Applejack: Then we'll have to buy ourselves some time so you can keep workin' on it!
Rarity: But how do you propose we do that?
Rainbow Dash: We compete in the Battle of the Bands for 
real! I take over lead vocals again and we stay alive until the finals! 
We unleash the counter-spell then! [to Twilight] You'll have figured it out by finals, right?
Spike: Of course she will. Twilight Sparkle's never met a problem she couldn't solve. Right, Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle: [not so confidently] Right.
Rainbow Dash: Then let's go win us a Battle of the Bands!
Principal Celestia: Welcome to the first ever Canterlot 
High School Battle of the Bands. I believe I speak for everyone when I 
say it is by far the greatest thing we have ever done here at this 
school!
[students cheering]
Principal Celestia: We are so glad our three newest students encouraged us to turn this event into something exciting!
Vice Principal Luna: But, as this is now a competition, we can only choose one winner. Who is it going to be?
[students arguing]
Male Student: You're the worst thing to happen!
Adagio Dazzle: You feel that, girls? Our true power is being restored.
Aria Blaze and Sonata Dusk: [giggling]
Adagio Dazzle: And that's before we've tapped into the strongest magic here.
Aria Blaze: But the Rainblossoms, or whatever they're called, aren't under our spell. How exactly are we supposed to get to their magic?
Adagio Dazzle: The Rainbooms are just as capable of 
falling apart as anyone else. They just need a little... push in the 
wrong direction. I have a feeling everyone here is going to be lining up
 to give them a shove.
[Snips]
[beatboxing poorly]

[Snails]
Aw, yeah! Snips and Snails indahouse, yo!

[Snips]
They call me MC Snips and that ain't no lie
My favorite food is like pumpkin pie

[Snails]
I'm DJ Snazzy Snails, I like whales
When I go to the beach, I always bring my pails

[Snips]
[beatboxing poorly]
Everybody knows my favorite color is orange
My rhymes are so fly, they're better than... um...

[Snails]
Than an orange, yo!

[Snips]
Yeah!

[Snails]
Yeah!

[Snips]
Represent!

[Snips and Snails]
[beatboxing and freestyling poorly]

[Snips]
What do we... What do we do now?

[Snails]
Get off the stage, I'd like to leave right now

[Snips and Snails]
[beatboxing and freestyling poorly]

[Snips]
Bam! That just happened!

[Snails]
Aw, yeah! We out!

[Snips]
Snips and Snails outta here!

[microphone feedback]
Principal Celestia: Please do not drop the microphones.
Snips: Yeah! Bam!
Snails: [laughing]
Snips: In your face, Rainbooms!
Applejack: Least we know one group who won't stand in the way of us gettin' to the finals.
Rainbow Dash: Let's get ready to rock!
Pinkie Pie: Wait! Where's Rarity?
Rarity: Oh! Here! I'm here! [panting]
[metal fringes jangling]
Rarity: We will be performing in front of an audience. I'm not going to wear something fabulous? Hmph.
Applejack: Guh...
[students chattering]
Twilight Sparkle: Remember, we have to be good enough to make it through but not so good we let the sirens see the magic within us. They could realize we plan to use it against them.
Rainbow Dash: Got it! Be cool enough to win, but not so cool that we end up showing off the whole ears and tails and rainbows thing. Sooo... about twenty percent less cool.
Pinkie Pie: One! Two!
[The Rainbooms]
We've just got the day to get ready
And there's only so much time to lose
Because tonight, yeah, we're here to party
So let's think of something fun to do

We don't know (we don't know) what's gonna happen
We just know (we just know) it's gonna feel right
All our friends are here
And it's time to ignite the lights!

Shake your tail 'cause we're here to have a party tonight
Shake your tail, shake your tail
Shake your tail 'cause we're here to have a party tonight
Shake your tail, shake your tail

[Twilight Sparkle]
So what you didn't get it right the first time

Apple Bloom: Boring!
[Pinkie Pie]
Laugh it off, no one said it is a crime

[Rarity]
Do your thing, you know you're an original

[Applejack]
Your ideas are so funny that they're criminal

[The Rainbooms]
Ohhh-ahh!

Twilight Sparkle: [coughing]
[The Rainbooms]
We've just got the day to get ready
And there's only so much time to lose
Because tonight, yeah, we're here to party
So let's think of something fun to do

Snips and Snails: [laughing]
Snips: Awesome.
[The Rainbooms]
We don't know (we don't know) what's gonna happen
We just know (we just know) it's gonna feel right
All our friends are here
And it's time to ignite the lights!

Shake your tail 'cause we're here to have a party tonight
Shake your tail, shake your tail
Shake your tail 'cause we're here to have a party tonight
Shake your tail, shake your tail
Shake your tail 'cause we're here to have a party tonight
Shake your tail, shake your tail

Rarity: [gasps] [crying]
[The Rainbooms]
Shake your tail 'cause we're here to have a party tonight
Shake your tail, shake your tail

Shake your tail 'cause we're here to have a party tonight!

Principal Celestia and Vice Principal Luna: [applauding]
Rarity: Ruined! Absolutely ruined!
Applejack: Rarity, were you tryin' to make us lose out there?!
Rarity: Wh- Oh! This was not my fault! This was an act of sabotage!
Applejack: Yeah, well, whoever did this couldn't have done this if you didn't insist on dressin' like... like... this! We need to sound good! Is there some reason that concept seems to escape you?
Rainbow Dash: And what was with the confetti, Pinkie Pie? How am I supposed to shred if there's paper stuck in my frets?!
Fluttershy: It was pretty distracting...
Pinkie Pie: Ugh! Says the girl who was running from a light the whole time! A light!
Sunset Shimmer: You still sounded much better than most 
of the other bands. I'm sure you'll make it to the next round. But it 
won't matter if you don't have that counter-spell ready. You all find a 
place to practice where the sirens can't hear you. I'll keep an eye on 
things around here.
Derpy: [playing musical saw]
Twilight Sparkle: I don't think we should use a classroom. [nervous chuckle] We really need to stop bumping into each other like this.
Flash Sentry: [to bandmates] Uh, you guys hear something?
"Brawly Beats": Uhh-uhh.
"Ringo": Uh, nope.
Twilight Sparkle: I said, we have to stop—
Flash Sentry: There it is again. So annoying.
Twilight Sparkle: Why are you acting like this? I thought we were friends.
Flash Sentry: Yeah, and then you decide to come back here just so you can beat me in the Battle of the Bands. I want this, Twilight, and you're trying to take it from me! Some friend.
Twilight Sparkle: That's not why—
Applejack: Come on, Twilight. We've got things to do.
Flash Sentry: You really think you're gonna help them?! Ha! I bet you have no idea what you're even doing!
Adagio Dazzle: [chuckling] Tears already? This is only the first round.
Aria Blaze and Sonata Dusk: [laughing]
Principal Celestia: The next band to take the stage will be Trixie and the Illusions.
Adagio Dazzle: Better head back. We're supposed to go on after Trixie.
Sunset Shimmer: You're never gonna get away with this.
Adagio Dazzle: Why? Because you didn't? Oh, we know all about you, Sunset Shimmer. You've got quite the reputation at Canterlot High.
Sunset Shimmer: I've changed! I'm in a much better place now!
Aria Blaze: Waiting in the wings while your friends have all the fun?
Adagio Dazzle: Oh, yes, you girls are so tight. And yet... they didn't ask you to be in the band.
Aria Blaze: Probably afraid no one would want to see them play if she was in the group.
Sonata Dusk: Too bad! So sad!
Adagio Dazzle: If it's any consolation, no one is going to remember you at all by the time we're done.
Adagio Dazzle: Remember, girls. We want to save the good stuff for when our full power has been restored.
[The Dazzlings]
Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh
You didn't know that you fell
Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh

[Adagio Dazzle]
Now that you're under our spell

Blindsided by the beat
Clapping your hands, stomping your feet
You didn't know that you fell

[Sonata Dusk and Aria Blaze]
Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Adagio Dazzle]
Now you've fallen under our spell

[Sonata Dusk and Aria Blaze]
Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

[The Dazzlings]
We've got the music, makes you move it
Got the song that makes you lose it
We say "jump", you say "how high?"
Put your hands up to the sky

We've got the music, makes you move it
Got the song that makes you lose it
We say "jump", you say "how high?"
Put your hands up to the sky

Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh
You didn't know that you fell
Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh
Now that you're under our spell

[Adagio Dazzle]
Listen to the sound of my voice

[Sonata Dusk and Aria Blaze]
Oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh

[Adagio Dazzle]
Soon you'll find you don't have a choice

[Sonata Dusk and Aria Blaze]
Oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh

[Adagio Dazzle]
Captured in the web of my song

[Sonata Dusk and Aria Blaze]
Oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh

[Adagio Dazzle]
Soon you'll all be singing along

[Sonata Dusk and Aria Blaze]
Oh, whoa, oh

[The Dazzlings]
We've got the music, makes you move it
Got the song that makes you lose it
We say "jump", you say "how high?"
Put your hands up to the sky

We've got the music, makes you move it

Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh

Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh
You didn't know that you fell
Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh
Now that you're under our

[Adagio Dazzle]
Spell

[maniacal laughter]
Sunset Shimmer: This is it! Last round and you're in the finals! Unless you think the counter-spell is ready to be played now.
Applejack: Don't worry, Twilight. Finals aren't until 
tonight. We'll get in a little more practice before we're supposed to 
hit the stage. We won't let you down!
Rest of main cast: ["Mm-hmm!", "Yeah!", etc.]
Twilight Sparkle: You won't let me down...
Fluttershy: Um, I was just wondering. We haven't played any of my songs yet, and...
Rainbow Dash: It's the semifinals. We gotta do "Awesome As I Wanna Be".
Fluttershy: Don't know why I even asked...
[Trixie Lulamoon]
...I got tricks up my sleeve
See me dominate
'Cause I'm powerful and grea-ea-eat!

Crowd: [cheering]
Principal Celestia: [laughing] Fantastic!
Trixie Lulamoon: Hmph. You're never gonna top that 
performance, "Rain-goons". You shouldn't be allowed to when you have 
such a big advantage over the rest of us.
Rainbow Dash: My superior guitar playing and off-the-charts awesome singing voice?
Trixie Lulamoon: Oh, don't be ridiculous. I mean her!
 If you were really all that, Rainbow Dash, you wouldn't have needed to 
bring in some magical ringer to have half a chance. Everyone's talking 
about it.
Rainbow Dash: Ha! Puh-leeze! I could win this thing as a solo act and everybody knows it!
Trixie Lulamoon: [scoffs] Sure you could.
[poof]
Main cast: [coughing]
Pinkie Pie: She's gone! [pause] Oh, wait. There she is.
[peeyow!]
Principal Celestia: Next up, the Rainbooms.
Spike: Knock 'em dead, Rainbooms!
Sunset Shimmer: I'll be here... just... watching.
[The Rainbooms]
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

[Rainbow Dash]
Awesome as I wanna be

[The Rainbooms]
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

[Rainbow Dash]
Awesome as I wanna be

First you see me riding on a sonic boom
Got my guitar shreddin' up my latest tune
There is nothin' you can do to beat me
I'm so good that you can't defeat me

[Rainbow Dash and the Rainbooms]
Yeah, I'm awesome, take caution
Watch out for me, I'm awesome as I wanna be
(Yeah!) I'm awesome, take caution
Watch out for me, I'm awesome as I wanna be

[The Rainbooms]
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

[instruments clattering]
[music stops]
Fluttershy: [squeals]
Flash Sentry: Now that's the bad girl we love to hate!
Crowd: [jeering]
Octavia Melody: I knew she was still trouble!
Male student: The real Sunset Shimmer is back!
Sunset Shimmer: No. It isn't like that.
Rainbow Dash: What was that?!
Sunset Shimmer: You were showing them your magic. I-I didn't know what else to do.
Rarity: Ugh. Close the curtains? Unplug her amp? Give us a chance to deal with the situation?
Sunset Shimmer: I'm sorry, I just wanted to help.
Rainbow Dash: Yeah, well, you didn't.
Applejack: None of this would've happened if you weren't tryin' to show off – as usual.
Trixie Lulamoon: Good show, "Rain-brooms". I especially 
liked the part where Sunset Shimmer, in a fit of jealous rage, knocked 
out Rainbow Dash mid-guitar solo!
Sunset Shimmer: It wasn't a fit of jealous rage!
Trixie Lulamoon: If you say so. Ooh! Looks like they've 
already decided who'll be moving on to the finals! I'm guessing it 
wasn't too difficult a decision.
[door opens]
The Dazzlings: [vocalizing]
Sunset Shimmer: Huh?
Rarity: What can we do? There isn't gonna be another opportunity for us to play. And I had the most gorgeous outfit for the finals!
Applejack: Yup, 'cause that's the real tragedy here, Rarity – that you won't get to play dress-up!
Rarity: You know perfectly well that is not what I meant!
Rainbow Dash: You guys wanna keep it down? They're about to announce who's moving on.
Fluttershy: Who are you kidding? You know it isn't gonna be us.
Principal Celestia: The band that will be joining the Dazzlings in tonight's finals... The Rainbooms!
Trixie Lulamoon: What?!
Main cast: Huh?
Pinkie Pie: Did they just say, "the Rainbooms"?!
Trixie Lulamoon: This isn't over!
Principal Celestia: Congratulations, girls. You deserve it.
Pinkie Pie: Seriously?! We didn't even finish our—!
Adagio Dazzle: See you at tonight's big show, Rainbooms. We are really looking forward to it.
Rainbow Dash: Yeah, well... not as much as we are!
Crowd: [jeering]
Photo Finish: Zis never should haf been you, Rainbooms!
Crowd: [jeering]
Trixie Lulamoon: This is a travesty! A travesty!
Adagio Dazzle: It really is! The Rainbooms don't deserve to be in the finals. Not when your band was so much better in the semis.
Aria Blaze: And wanted it so much more.
Adagio Dazzle: Alas, this is the way it's going to be. Dazzlings vs. Rainbooms.
Sonata Dusk: Unless, of course, the Rainbooms don't manage to make it to their set or held up for some reason.
Trixie Lulamoon: Hmm... [sinister chuckling]
Rainbow Dash: Check, one, two. Testing, testing... [taps microphone] Testing...!
[voice echoes]
[microphone feedback]
Fluttershy: This doesn't make any sense. We were awful. 
Doesn't anybody else think it's strange that we're the ones that made it
 to the finals?
Trixie Lulamoon: Very strange.
Rainbow Dash: What are you doing here, Trixie? Pretty sure the losers are supposed to be up there in the cheap seats.
Trixie Lulamoon: The Great and Powerful Trixie is the most talented girl at Canterlot High. It is I who deserves to be in the finals. And I will not... [snaps fingers] ...be denied!
[trap door clanks open]
Rainbooms and Sunset Shimmer: [screams] [grunts]
Trixie Lulamoon: [evil laughter] See you never!
[trap door slams shut]
Adagio Dazzle: [chuckle] Told you someone would give them a shove.
Sonata Dusk: She didn't shove them. She pulled a lever.
Aria Blaze: [groans] Go back to sleep, Sonata.
[Trixie Lulamoon]
Ya better believe
I got tricks up my sleeve
And I captivate
'Cause I'm powerful and grea-ea-eat

[The Illusions]
Oh, whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Trixie Lulamoon]
Ya better believe
I got tricks up my sleeve
See me dominate
'Cause I'm powerful and grea-ea-eat

[The Illusions]
Oh, whoa, oh oh oh oh

["Tricks Up My Sleeve" continues muffled]
Rainbow Dash: [grunts]
Applejack: Give it up, Rainbow Dash. You've been tryin' at this for hours. It's not gonna open.
Twilight Sparkle: Maybe it doesn't even matter that we're trapped down here. I don't think the counter-spell would have worked anyway.
Applejack: Of course it would have worked, Twilight. 
Assumin' a certain band member didn't try to hog the spotlight the whole
 time we were tryin' to play it!
Rainbow Dash: Hey! If you wanna tell Twilight she's 
getting a little too caught up trying to be the new leader of this band,
 you don't have to be all cryptic about it.
Rarity: She was talking about you, Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Dash: Me?! I'm just trying to make sure my band rocks as hard as it needs to!
Rarity, Applejack, Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie: OUR BAND!!
Twilight Sparkle: But why wasn't it working? I should know what to do. How could I not know what to do? How could I have failed like this?
Applejack: It might've been your idea to start a band, but it's not just your band, Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Dash: I'm the one who writes all the songs!
Fluttershy: I write songs! You just never let us play any of them!
Rarity: I had the most perfect outfits for us to wear!
Applejack: Again with the costumes! No one cares what we're wearin'!
Rarity: I care, Applejack! So sorry if I enjoy trying to make a creative contribution to the band!
Pinkie Pie: Hey! Anybody here remember fun?! I'll give you a hint: It's the exact opposite of being in the Rainbooms!
Rainbow Dash: I wish I never asked any of you to be in my band!
Rarity: I wish I'd never agreed to be in it!!!!
Fluttershy and Applejack: Me neither!
Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Fluttershy, Rarity and Pinkie Pie: [arguing]
[Trixie Lulamoon]
Ya better believe
I got tricks up my sleeve
See me dominate
'Cause I'm powerful and grea-ea-eat!

[fireworks]
[crowd cheering]
Trixie Lulamoon: Try to top that!
Adagio Dazzle: [sarcastically] Oh, gosh! I don't know if we can!
The Dazzlings: [laughing]
[The Dazzlings]
Ahh, ah-ah, ahh
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Fluttershy, Rarity and Pinkie Pie: [arguing]
Sunset Shimmer: Stop! You have to stop! This is what they've been after all along! They're feeding off of the magic inside you!
Applejack: How can they be using our magic? It's the magic of friendship.
Sunset Shimmer: Ever since you started this band, you've
 been letting little things get to you. I never said anything 'cause I 
didn't feel like it was my place. Not when I was so new to this whole 
"friendship" thing. I still have a lot to learn. But I do know 
that if you don't work out even the smallest problems right at the 
start, the magic of friendship can be turned into something else.
Twilight Sparkle: I can't believe all this tension was 
happening right under my nose and I didn't realize it. I'm supposed to 
be the one with all the answers. And all I've done since I got here is 
let you down.
Sunset Shimmer: I don't think anyone is supposed to have all the answers. But you can count on your friends to help you find them.
Twilight Sparkle: I think you already have. C'mon! We need to get out of here!
[slamming on door]
[knocking on door]
Twilight Sparkle: Spike!
Spike: Sorry I took so long. I had to find somebody who wasn't under the sirens' spell to help me get you out.
Twilight Sparkle: Why isn't she under their spell?
Spike: Never takes off her headphones.
Applejack: Come on, y'all! Time to prove we've still got the magic of friendship inside us!
Twilight Sparkle: And there's only one way to do it!
Pinkie Pie: We're getting the band back together?
Rainbow Dash: We're getting our band back together!
Pinkie Pie: Whee!
Rarity: Ooh, which version of the counter-spell are we going to play?
Twilight Sparkle: I don't think it matters what song we play, as long as we play it together as friends.
Rainbow Dash: I know just the song. Fluttershy's written a really great one.
Fluttershy: [squee]
Applejack: We're about to save the world here. Personally, I think we should do it in style. Rarity?
Rarity: I thought you'd never ask!
[The Dazzlings]
Ah-ha, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ha, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Adagio Dazzle]
Welcome to the show

[Sonata Dusk and Aria Blaze]
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah

[Adagio Dazzle]
We're here to let you know

[Sonata Dusk and Aria Blaze]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Adagio Dazzle]
Our time is now

[Sonata Dusk and Aria Blaze]
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah

[The Dazzlings]
Your time is running out

[Sonata Dusk and Aria Blaze]
Ah, ah, ah

[The Dazzlings]
Ah-ha, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah...

Rainbow Dash: How are we supposed to play over them from up here?
[car horn honks]
The Rainbooms: [cheer]
Pinkie Pie: Awesome!
Rainbow Dash: Sweet!
[The Dazzlings]
Feel the wave of sound
As it crashes down
You can't turn away
We'll make you wanna sta-a-a-ay

We will be adored
Tell us that you want us
We won't be ignored
It's time for our reward

Now you need us
Come and heed us
Nothing can stop us now

[The Rainbooms]
Oh-oh, oh-whoa-oh
I've got the music in me
Oh-oh, oh-whoa-oh

[Twilight Sparkle]
Don't need to hear a crowd
Cheering out my name
I didn't come here seeking
Infamy or fame

[The Rainbooms]
The one and only thing
That I am here to bring
Is music, is the music
Is the music in my soul

Gonna break out (Out!)
Set myself free, yeah
Let it all go (Go!)
Just let it be, yeah

Find the music in your heart
Let the music make you start
To set yourself apart

Adagio Dazzle: So the Rainbooms want to turn this into a real Battle of the Bands? Then let's battle!
[The Dazzlings]
What we have in store (ah-ah)
All we want and more (ah-ah)
We will break on through (ah-ah)
Now it's time to finish you!

[instrumental]
Twilight Sparkle: [vocalizing]
Sirens: [vocalizing]
Twilight Sparkle: Sunset Shimmer, we need you!
[drum solo]
[Sunset Shimmer]
You're never gonna bring me down
You're never gonna break this part of me
My friends are here to bring me 'round
Not singing just for popularity

[Sunset Shimmer and Twilight Sparkle]
We're here to let you know
That we won't let it go

[The Rainbooms]
Our music is a bomb and it's about to blow

[Sunset Shimmer and Twilight Sparkle]
And you can try to fight
But we have got the light of

[The Rainbooms]
Friendship on our side!

Got the music in our hearts
We're here to blow this thing apart
And together, we will never
Be afraid of the dark

Here to sing our song out loud
Get you dancing with the crowd
As the music of our friendship
Survives, survives!

[All sans Dazzlings]
Got the music in our hearts
We're here to blow this thing apart
And together, we will never
Be afraid of the dark

Here to sing our song out loud
Get you dancing with the crowd
As the music of our friendship
Survives, survives, survives!

[The Dazzlings]
[singing off-key]
We will be adored
Tell us that you want us
We won't be ignored
It's time for our reward...

Crowd: [booing]
Sunset Shimmer: Guess that explains why these were so special to them.
Twilight Sparkle: Without those pendants and the magic you brought here from Equestria, they're just three harmless teenage girls.
Flash Sentry: Rainbooms rule! That was amazing!
Sunset Shimmer and Main cast sans Twilight: [giggling]
Trixie Lulamoon: You may have vanquished the Dazzlings, 
but you will never have the amazing, show-stopping ability of the Great 
and Powerful Trixie!
[poof]
Main cast, Sunset Shimmer, and Flash Sentry: [coughing]
Pinkie Pie: She's gone! [pause] Oh, wait. There she is.
[thud]
Trixie Lulamoon: Trixie's okay!
Rainbow Dash: You know, Twilight is going back to 
Equestria soon. The Rainbooms could really use someone to help 
Fluttershy on backup vocals.
Sunset Shimmer: [plays guitar riff] I also play guitar.
Rainbow Dash: We'll see.
Applejack: Sure wish you could stay longer.
Twilight Sparkle: Me too. But I have responsibilities in
 Equestria that I have to get back to. Its citizens need me. But now I 
can go through the portal whenever I need to. This isn't goodbye. It's 
just goodbye 'til next time. Ready?
Spike: Ready!
Sunset Shimmer: [voiceover] Dear Princess Twilight,
Missing you already, and I hope you'll be back soon. Things 
are definitely looking up for me here at Canterlot High. But I know I 
still have a lot to learn about friendship. Hope you don't mind if I 
write to you for advice when I need it.
Your friend, Sunset Shimmer.
Rainbow Dash: You ready or what?
Sunset Shimmer: Ready!
Pinkie Pie: One! Two! Three! Four!

Once upon a time
You came into my world and made the stars align

[Rarity]
Now I can see the signs
You pick me up when I get down so I can shine

[The Rainbooms]
Shine like rainbows
Shine like rainbows

[Rainbow Dash]
Friends, you are in my life
And you can count on me to be there by your side

[Sunset Shimmer]
And when the music comes alive
We sing our songs to lift us up so we can shine

[The Rainbooms]
And the sound that we hear in our hearts
Makes a crescendo
And the light that ignites in the dark
It makes us all glow

And shine like rainbows
We shine like rainbows

Together we stand
As the rain begins to fall
And holdin' our heads up high
As the sun shines through it all

[The cast]
And the sound that we hear in our hearts
Makes a crescendo
And the light that ignites in the dark
It makes us all glow

And shine like rainbows
We shine like rainbows
Shine like rainbows
We shine like rainbows

[The Rainbooms]
We shine like rainbows

Sci-Twi: No doubt about it, Spike. There's definitely something strange going on at that school...
Puppy Spike: [barks]
