Triple Pony Dare YaEditGranny Smith: Seven... Eight... Nine... No, that's a button. I wonder what that goes to. Uh, lemme check.
Rainbow Dash: [deep inhale, long sigh, deep inhale]
Pinkie Pie: Mmmm! Don't you just love Granny's Hearth's Warming fruitcake? [to Applejack] Uh, what's wrong with her?
Applejack: Triple Pony Dare. I bet Rainbow Dash she couldn't wait patiently in this line all the way to the end.
Pinkie Pie: Wow. There's Triple Pony Dares, and then there's just impossible!
Rainbow Dash: [straining, screams] Out of my way!
Applejack: Told ya so! I win, fair and square.
Rainbow Dash: No, you don't! I didn't Triple Dare you back! First one to finish a Dare, they're Triple Pony Dare champion! Forever!
Rainbow Dash and Applejack: Hmph!
Rainbow Dash: Triple Pony Dare ya. No touching, no wearing, for one... whole... moon!
[bionic clicking]
Applejack: I missed you so much, Tallulah!
[whooshing]
Applejack: Triple Pony Dare ya, Rainbow Dash! Fly slower than apple molasses!
[screech!]
Rainbow Dash: [straining] Aah!
Rainbow Dash: Keep going. You need twenty more to win this Dare.
Applejack: [straining] Whoa...! [screams, groans]
Rainbow Dash: [laughs]
Applejack: You gotta dig five holes before sunset – Earth pony style!
Rainbow Dash: [grunts]
[clang!]
Rainbow Dash: [warbling]
[crack]
Rainbow Dash: Buck one and only one.
Applejack: [gulps]
[soft tap]
[thud]
[flump!]
Rainbow Dash: [laughs]
Pinkie Pie: So? Find a Triple Pony Dare champion forever yet?
Applejack: It should be me! If Rainbow Dash didn't keep comin' up with such lowdown, nasty Dares.
Rainbow Dash: Me?! Do you know how hard it is to fly slow?!
Pinkie Pie: [gasps] I just figured out how to settle this whole thing!
Rainbow Dash: You did?
Pinkie Pie: Uh-huh. I Triple Pony Dare you... to quit daring each other!
Applejack: No way!
Rainbow Dash: Me, neither!
Pinkie Pie: Guess that means... I'm the winner! I win! I win! I win! Uh-huh! Oh, yeah! [giggles]
The Great Escape RoomEdit[crunch]
Rainbow Dash: Hey! You stepped on my tail!
Applejack: Sorry. Can't see a darn thing.
Fluttershy: Did Pinkie Pie say what her Hearth's Warming Eve surprise was going to be?
[click]
Mane Six except Pinkie Pie: [yelp]
Pinkie Pie: Welcome to my amazingly amazing escape room! So? You amazed?
[beat]
Rarity: Yes. Because it looks remarkably like Applejack's barn.
Pinkie Pie: Oh, it's sooo much more. Holiday clues, 
puzzles, and riddles are hidden everywhere! And until you solve them to 
find the key...
[rattle]
Pinkie Pie: We're locked inside!
Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Fluttershy, and Rarity: [gasp]
Twilight Sparkle: Come on, everypony. We're experts at escape rooms now.
Pinkie Pie: Good! 'Cause if we don't get out of here in time, something super big and really scary is going to happen!
Fluttershy: What kind of something?
Pinkie Pie: I don't remember.
Rarity: But... But you created this escape room!
Pinkie Pie: Uh-huh. Then I made sure to forget everything so I can play, too. Whee!
Rainbow Dash: That's not what the clue means. We're supposed to lick the candy canes, then sing carols.
Applejack: The way I see it, we gallop backwards, whistle carols, then lick 'em.
Pinkie Pie: Why not try both?
[gramophone playing]
Pinkie Pie: [whistles]
Rainbow Dash: [straining]
Fluttershy: [straining]
Rarity: Two hundred thousand, seventy-four... Two hundred thousand, seventy-five... Two hundred thousand, sev...
Twilight Sparkle: Pinkie, what does any of this have to do with finding a key?
Pinkie Pie: We're having fun!
Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy: [gasp]
Pinkie Pie: [giggling]
Rarity: Oh, poo! I've lost count! One... Two...
[music]
[clock ticking]
[bell clanging]
Rainbow Dash: Well? Which one of these is the thing you need for the perfect Hearth's Warming Eve?
Pinkie Pie: All of them! [squee] Yay!
Fluttershy: [cries]
[buzzing]
Mane Six except Pinkie Pie: [gasp]
Pinkie Pie: And time's up! And you didn't find the key, so get ready. What's gonna happen?!
Mane Six except Pinkie Pie: [scared noises]
[whirring]
Mane Six except Pinkie Pie: [gasp]
[squeak!]
Pinkie Pie: Oh, yeah! That's what it was! Woo-hoo! Wasn't that sooo much fun?!
Twilight Sparkle: Uh... "fun" is a very strong word.
Gummy: [blows noisemaker]
Mystery VoiceEditRarity: Welcome, class. Today, we are going to make dolls for Hearth's Warming Eve.
[loudspeaker whines]
[microphone taps]
Loudspeaker: Good morning, students and teachers. Due to the snow, Yodeling Club is canceled. Thank you.
[click]
Rarity: Hmm. Odd. That didn't sound like Twilight. Well, as I was saying—
[loudspeaker whines]
Loudspeaker: Hi-hi-hi! One more thing. Urban yovidaphone practice is postponed 'til after holiday break. Ta for now!
[click]
Rarity: Ta indeed! Now, if that is all...
[beat]
Rarity: Wonderful. As I was saying, I think you're going to find this project very—
[loudspeaker whines]
Loudspeaker: the fun and games society regrets to inform you that today's outdoor chess event is being rescheduled! Scheduled... scheduled...!
[click]
Rarity: [annoyed tone] As I was saying—
[loudspeaker whines]
Loudspeaker: have a great day!
[click]
Rarity: [growls] That does it! Enough interruptions!
[door opens, slams]
[thud]
[smack!]
Rarity: What are you two doing here?
Rainbow Dash: I can't get through a sentence without being cut off! I'm gonna tell those announcers to pipe down!
Fluttershy: I'm gonna ask them politely! I've been trying to teach my students how to feed a hedgehog—
[loudspeaker whines]
Loudspeaker: [high-pitched] And don't forget! The Jump-Rope Jamboree is also canceled!
Fluttershy: But that keeps happening.
Rainbow Dash: Let's go have a friendly teacher chat with those announcers. On three.
Rarity: One...
Fluttershy: Two...
Rainbow Dash: Three!
[door opens]
Applejack: [high-pitched] Sorry for the inconvenience!
Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, and Rarity: Applejack?!
Applejack: Oh, hey! What do you think? Twilight said I 
could do the announcements today. With all the bad news, I thought I'd 
give 'em some flavor.
Rainbow Dash: Wait. All those voices were yours?
Applejack: [chuckles] Sure were. Want to hear another?
Rarity: Actually, if you don't mind saving them, I think we have a perfect Hearth's Warming solution for the blizzard outside.
Applejack: [non-accented] This land shall be known as Unicornia. [normally] ...proclaimed Princess Platinum. [gruffly] pegasopolis!
 [normally] ...demanded Commander Hurricane. [high-pitched] Dirtville! 
[normally] ...suggested Chancellor Puddinghead. And still the windigos 
raged outside. [spooky noises]
Rarity's Biggest FanEditTwilight Sparkle: I'll have my usual mane style. Thank you, Aloe.
Rarity: [fake cough] Not again.
Twilight Sparkle: Do you need some water?
Rarity: Oh, I'm fine, darling. But why couldn't you try something different for once? A chic updo will simply scream "headmare"!
Twilight Sparkle: I'm not sure I want my mane to scream anything. [to Aloe] I'll just have the same as always.
Rarity: Oh, bother. Of course you will.
Twilight Sparkle: What can I say? I know what I like. But there's nothing stopping you from trying a new style.
Rarity: I do feel the winds of change rustling my mane. But what to get? Hmm... [groans] I need something spectacular!
[wind whistling]
Rarity: Something... moving!
[window closes]
Twilight Sparkle: Princesses Celestia and Luna are the only ones with manes like that.
Rarity: Not for long!
Rarity: [grunting] Oh, come on, mane! Move! [sputters] There must be a secret to it.
[magic zap]
[cracking]
[hairspray hissing]
[cracking]
[wind whistling]
[train whistle blows]
"All Aboard": Last stop!
[ponies chattering]
Rarity: Oh, poo!
Spike: Oh, uh, hey, Rarity. I picked up that fabric you asked me to. Anything else you need?
Rarity: [gasps]
[wings flapping]
Rarity: Now that you mention it...
[door opens]
Twilight Sparkle: Rarity! I can't believe you figured it out! What's the secret to the spell?
Rarity: Actually, there was no spell. All it takes is... [clears throat]
[wind whistling]
Rarity: ...a big fan!
Spike: [panting]
Rarity: Thank you, Spikey-Wikey. Now, come along. We've got things to do and ponies who need to see me!
Spike: [groans]
Twilight Sparkle: [giggles]
Ail-icornEditTwilight Sparkle: [sneezes]
Spike: I've tried everything! Poultices, soup, a poultice made of soup. But nothing's helping Twilight get better!
Twilight Sparkle: [congested] I told you, Spike. It's just a little spring allergy— [sneezes]
[magic zap]
Twilight Sparkle: —in my horn.
Rarity: Strange. I've never had a horn allergy.
Rainbow Dash: Must be an Alicorn thing.
Rarity: Oh, pity. The glitter is simply par excellence.
Spike: Uh, I wouldn't do that.
[poof!]
Spike: Told ya.
[whiffle!]
[stretching]
[snap!]
Applejack: That... is the fifth strangest thing I've ever seen.
Rarity: How do I get it off?!
[thud]
Rarity: Whoa! Whoopsie! Ugh.
Twilight Sparkle: [coughing]
[teleportation zap]
Fluttershy: S-So... c-c-c-c-c-cold...!
Spike: See? We gotta do something to stop Twilight from sneezing magic!
Twilight Sparkle: Sorry. But there's nothing you can do. Everything I've read says this just has to run its cour— Ah...
Rainbow Dash: Take cover!
Twilight Sparkle: Ah... Ah... [sneezes loudly]
[magic zap]
Applejack: Uh-oh! Whoooaaa! [screaming]
Twilight Sparkle: Sorry, Applejack.
Rainbow Dash: I'll get you down!
Twilight Sparkle: [sneezes]
[magic zap]
Rainbow Dash: [horn honks, sawing sounds]
Spike: Uh... what'd she say?
Rainbow Dash: [jackhammering, slide whistle, chicken squawk]
Fluttershy: I don't know. Not even I speak sound effect.
[knocking]
Rarity: This is ridiculous! We simply must find a cure!
[thud]
Pinkie Pie: [muffled] Never fear!
[door opens]
Pinkie Pie: Pinkie Pie is here! Special delivery from Zecora!
Rainbow Dash: [drill sound, cuckoo clock, cat yowl, bionic clicking]
Pinkie Pie: That's what I said. Anyhoo, Zecora promised this potion will cure Twilight!
Twilight Sparkle: [gulping, hiccups]
[poof!]
[thud]
Rainbow Dash: Aw, yeah!
[poof!]
Twilight Sparkle: It worked!
Pinkie Pie: Except...
[poof!]
Pinkie Pie: ...there may be some teensy-eensy side effects.
Baby Twilight Sparkle: [crying]
Teacher of the MonthEditApplejack: Hey, Fluttershy! Congrats on bein' Teacher of the Month. Again. What is this, number fifteen?
Fluttershy: Oh, um... sixteen, actually. [giggles]
Rainbow Dash: What's your secret? Say some other pony wanted to be Teacher of the Month. What should she do?
Fluttershy: Well, um, I'm not exactly sure.
[students chattering]
Fluttershy: All right, class. Time to tidy up.
Students: Awww...
Fluttershy: I mean, it's time for a clean-up dance party!
[thud]
[dance music]
Students: Yay! [laughing]
[camera clicks]
Fluttershy: Today, we're gonna learn about responsibility.
Students: [groan]
Fluttershy: By taking care of baby animals!
Students: Yay!
[camera clicks]
[rain falling]
Fluttershy: Sorry, everyone. Looks like we have to cancel our field trip because of the weather.
Students: Awww...
Fluttershy: We'll just have to stay here and play games instead!
Students: Yay!
[camera clicks]
Applejack: Wow. You really are a great teacher.
Rainbow Dash: So? Teach us! How can we get our picture on that wall?
[dance music]
Applejack: Welcome to the first annual Student Appreciation School Party!
Rainbow Dash: Set up and hosted by us!
Students: Yay!
Fluttershy: I definitely think they should be Teachers of the Month, don't you?
[students muttering in agreement]
Applejack: Thanks for your help, Fluttershy. We wouldn've never thought of this without you.
Smolder: Wait.
[music stops]
Smolder: This was Fluttershy's idea?
Rainbow Dash: Well...
Applejack: Uh, yup.
Students: [laughing]
[camera clicks]
Rainbow Dash and Applejack: [laugh, sigh]
Starlight the HypnotistEdit[door knocks]
[door opens]
Starlight Glimmer: Oh, hey, Twilight. Did you knock?
Twilight Sparkle: No! I mean, yes! I mean, am I interrupting something? I'll come back later.
Starlight Glimmer: No, stay. I was just fixing Pinkie Pie's kite. Uh, is everything okay?
Twilight Sparkle: [laughing nervously] Well, since you asked, there is a little tiny something bothering me.
Starlight Glimmer: Oh. [chuckles] Then you've come to the right counselor.
Twilight Sparkle: Oh, wow. This is actually kind of embarrassing, but...
Starlight Glimmer: But...?
Twilight Sparkle: The thing is, I'm terrified of... of...
Twilight Sparkle: [gasps, screams]
[spoon clatters]
Twilight Sparkle: [screams]
Twilight Sparkle: [screams, yelping]
Starlight Glimmer: Ladybugs? Like the cute, little, red beetle things with black spots?
Twilight Sparkle: When I was a filly, a swarm of them 
got into our house. Shining Armor told me that their spots were extra 
eyes watching you wherever you go! So creepy! [whimpers] Ever since 
Fluttershy assigned the students that ladybug care project, they're 
everywhere! What's this? "Magical Hypnosis for Phobias: A Beginner's Guide".
Starlight Glimmer: Mm-hmm. I've been studying the 
techniques. Want to give it a shot? Okay! All you have to do is keep 
your eyes on the star. You should begin to feel sleepy any moment. 
[echoing] Just listen to the sound of my voice. Instead of being afraid 
when you see a ladybug, you will now—
[door bursts open]
Pinkie Pie: Kite-flying time! Woo-hoo!
Twilight Sparkle: Ladybug... Kite-flying time... Woo-hoo... [groans]
Starlight Glimmer: [groans]
Twilight Sparkle: [yelps] Can't see me now, huh?! What's wrong?! Got clouds in your eyes, spots?! [crazed laughter]
Pinkie Pie: Wow! Twilight really likes her new kite. But why does she keep yelling at it to stop looking at her?
Starlight Glimmer: [groans]
Sundae, Sundae, SundaeEditPinkie Pie: Step right up, everypony, to the coolest attraction in all of Equestria! [slurps, giggles]
[ponies chattering]
Pinkie Pie: And I mean cool.
Daisy: Ooh...
Pinkie Pie: This show is cooler than a snow sandwich in Yakyakistan.
Sea Swirl: Ooh...
Pinkie Pie: What icy treasures await you ponies behind this very curtain? Oh! I'm glad you asked. 'Cause I've got the "scoop"!
[thud]
Pinkie Pie: A big one! Presenting the one, the only... Sugarcube Corner Ice Cream Museum!
[squeak!]
[ponies cheering]
Mrs. Cake: [clears throat] Uh, Pinkie Pie? Uh—
Pinkie Pie: The Sugarcube Corner Ice Cream Museum is the only place where you can learn about the history of ice cream and
 admire whatever flavor you favor! [giggles] Come on, everypony. Revere 
the rocky road! Commend the cookie dough! Marvel at the mint chip! And 
don't forget to take a dip in the rainbow sprinkle pool! It's so 
beautiful!
Mr. Cake: [worried sound]
Mrs. Cake: Pinkie Pie, dear, the ice cream is going to—
Pinkie Pie: Be delicious! That's right, Mrs. Cake! Because there's tasting spoons for everypony! You get a spoon, and you get a spoon, and you get a spoon, and you get a spoon!
[ponies laughing]
Pinkie Pie: What could top that, you ask?
[beat]
Pinkie Pie: Go on. You ask.
Crowd Pony: Uh, what could... What could top—?
Pinkie Pie: Toppings! Jimmies, gummies, crumbles, jumbles, sprinkles, pickles... [gasps] And that's just the first row!
Mrs. Cake: Well, why don't we go inside and see?
Pinkie Pie: [gasps] Tell me, Cranky. What flavor of ice cream are you most excited about?
Cranky Doodle Donkey: Vanilla.
Pinkie Pie: Well, you're in luck! 'Cause this museum's got that, too! Now, who's ready to chill out with me?!
[ponies cheering]
Pinkie Pie: Welcome to...
Mrs. Cake: [whimpers]
[ponies gasp]
Pinkie Pie: The Sugarcube Corner Ice Cream— [gasps] Soup Museum?
Cranky Doodle Donkey: Good. I can't stand eating cold things.
Pinkie Pie: [slurps] Mmmm! [gasps]
[splash!]
Pinkie Pie: Melted is my new favorite flavor!
[ponies laughing]
