[Rachel Platten]
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

See the ponies trottin' down the street
Equestria is where they wanna meet
They all know where they wanna go
And they're trottin' in time
And they're trottin', yeah

They got the beat
They got the beat
They got the beat
Yeah, they got the beat

Go-go music really makes us dance
Do the pony, puts us in a trance
Do the watusi, just give us a chance
That's when we fall in line

'Cause we got the beat
We got the beat
We got the beat
Yeah, we got it!

Spike: 'Scuse me! Dragon on the move! Important princess documents comin' through!
S04E26 Unnamed Earth Mare #1: Whoa! Everypony from Manehattan to Saddle Arabia is here!
Apple Cobbler: I know, filly! We almost couldn't book a stable!
Clear Skies: Princess Twilight must have her hooves full with this giant Festival!
Female Pony 2: Are you kidding?! She's smart and organized and cool under pressure! There's nothing she can't handle!
Twilight Sparkle: Ommmmm... Ohhhhhhh mmmmy goodness, I 
can't handle this! Ooh! Nothing is working! I just have to get it 
together! Just go in there! And ask! This is your Friendship Festival! 
Everypony's happiness rests in your hooves. [facehoofs] Ohhhh!
Spike: Okay, Twilight. Got all your charts and graphs.
Twilight Sparkle: Oh, thank goodness you're here, Spike! I'm just so nervous about this meeting!
Spike: Whachoo talkin' 'bout?
Twilight Sparkle: [sighs] I'm about to ask the three most royal princesses of Equestria for a huge favor! What if they reject me?
Spike: It'll be fine. Just remember the most important thing.
Twilight Sparkle: Smile?!
Spike: Eh... no. You're a Princess, too.
Twilight Sparkle: Right! [exhales] Good morning, 
Princesses. Thank you all for seeing me. I have an idea that I think 
will make our Friendship Festival the most wonderful celebration 
Equestria has ever seen!
Princess Celestia: Yes, Twilight! We are very excited!
Princess Cadance: Ponies have been arriving from all over all morning.
Princess Luna: I'd like to think it's to see us, but Songbird Serenade might be the bigger attraction.
Twilight Sparkle: Yes, she is the... "mane" event! [giggles] And to make it extra special, I could use your help. Spike?
[whiteboard wheeling in]
Spike: [humming fanfare]
Twilight Sparkle: Songbird Serenade's performance is not
 scheduled to start until after you begin the sunset. And based on my 
precise calculation, to get the very best lighting for the stage, 
Princess Celestia, I was hoping you could make sure the sun stays about 
28.1º to the south, and, Princess Luna, if you could raise the moon 62º 
to the north at the same time, it would reflect the sunlight on the 
other side and really frame the entire stage perfectly!
Princess Luna: I...
Twilight Sparkle: But wait! There's more! Cadance, if you could use your crystal magic to create an aurora above the stage, the sun and the moon will shine through it and create a truly amazing light show!
Spike: Presenting Songbird Serenade!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Whoa-ho!

Whoa!
[bonk!]
Spike: [weakly] Ta-da...
Princess Luna: So you're saying you want us to move the sun and the moon for the party.
Twilight Sparkle: Well, I'd do it myself, except I don't have your magic. [snorts]
Princess Celestia: Twilight, each of us uses our powers to serve Equestria in our own way. You are the Princess of Friendship. You already have all the magic you need.
Twilight Sparkle: So... that'd be a no?
Rainbow Dash: Yes!
[zooming]
Rainbow Dash: Sky's cleared and ready for the festival!
Pinkie Pie: [blowing up a balloon]
[balloon squeaking]
[balloon deflating]
Pinkie Pie: Whoa!
[birds whistling in harmony]
[balloon zooming by]
Pinkie Pie: Whoa! Heads up, Fluttershy! Out of control balloooooon!!
Fluttershy: Hoo. I don't think it's the balloon that's out of control, Pinkie Pie!
Applejack: Hey, y'all!
Pinkie Pie: [screams]
Applejack: Anypony up for some free samples of my family's apple cider?
Rainbow Dash: Ah! Thank you! Loved it!
Rarity: [humming]
Applejack: Wow, Rarity. It's a fine job you're doin' there. 'Course it might not get done 'til after the concert.
Rarity: Applejack, darling, anypony can do "fine". Twilight asked me, so clearly, she's going for fabulous, and fabulous takes time.
Rainbow Dash: Fabulous takes forever! But "awesome"...
[flies past]
Fluttershy: Whoa!
Rainbow Dash: ...can get done in four seconds flat! Faster if I do my sonic rainboom!
Rarity: Aah! Nono, oh no! Don't you dare, Rainbow Dash! It looks wretched enough already.
Rainbow Dash: Oh come on, it's fine!
Rarity: If you were raised in a barn! Ahem, no offense, Applejack.
Applejack: None taken. Especially since I wasn't raised 
in a barn. My family just happens to have a barn. Where I was born. 
And... spent most of my formative years...
Rainbow Dash: [very quickly] Raised in a barn!
Twilight Sparkle: Okay, just two hundred and eighteen things left to do and we're ready.
Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie: Hey, Twilight!
Rarity: Hello, Spike.
Spike: Uh, hi, Rarity. Heh heh.
Applejack: How'd it go with the other Princesses? They like your idea?
Pinkie Pie: I bet they loved it!
Twilight Sparkle: [sighs] Not exactly. They think I can make today perfect without their magic.
Rarity: And they are absolutely right, darling. This festival is your brilliant idea and we know you're up to the task!
Twilight Sparkle: But what if I'm not?! What if Songbird
 Serenade hates the stage?! Or nopony makes a new friend?! And if I fail
 at the festival, then who am I?!
Pinkie Pie: Twilight, look at me! This will be the 
biggest celebration Equestria has ever seen! As the Princess of 
Friendship, you cannot fail! This day will define who you are! The 
pressure is intense! It's almost too much for any single pony to handle! [screams] 
[ponies gasp]
Pinkie Pie: But you have us! So stop worrying.
[clink!]
[magic whirs off]
[balloon pops]
Rainbow Dash: [burps]
Twilight Sparkle: Ah!
[Applejack]
It's time to show 'em what you've got

[Rarity]
It's time to go and get things done

[Fluttershy]
But you don't have to do it on your own

[Pinkie Pie]
'Cause you've got friends right here to make it fun

[Mane Five]
We got this, you got this
We got this together

Twilight Sparkle: Huh?
Spike: Whoa!
[Rainbow Dash]
Sometimes the pressure gets you down
And the clouds are dark and grey
Just kick them off and let the sun shine through

And scary as it seems, more help is on the way
'Cause friends have friends that wanna help out, too

[Rainbow Dash and Wonderbolts]
We got this, you got this
We got this together

[Crowd]
It's the Festival of Friendship
And we can get it done
A festival that they won't forget

A party to be proud of
A day of games and fun
Just you wait and see
A magic day in perfect harmony

[Fluttershy]
You got this

[Bird]
[whistles melody]

[Fluttershy and bird whistle]
We got this together

[Applejack]
With friends and family, you are never alone
If you need help, we've got your back
You can be honest, let your problems be known

[Applejack and Apple family]
'Cause you got us to pick up the slack
We got this

[Big McIntosh]
Eeyup!

[Apple family]
We got this together

[Rarity]
Pay attention to the details
Every gem even-spaced
Make the colors perfect

[Spike]
Takin' one or two to taste

[Rarity]
Inside and out, beautiful throughout
Generosity is what we're all about

[Spike]
[mouthful] You got this

[Rarity]
You got this

[Rarity and Spike]
We got this together

[Twilight Sparkle]
Today needs to be perfect, it all comes down to me
I don't know if I'm ready
For all the things they need me to be
I am the Princess of Friendship
But that is more than just a crown
It's a promise to bring ponies together
And never let anypony down

[Pinkie Pie]
We've got an awful lot to bake
Each pony needs a piece of cake
Oh, wait! There's something better we can do

We're gonna need some more supplies
To make a really big surprise
She'll be so shocked—she's sure to love it, too!

You got this!
We got this together!

[All]
It's the Festival of Friendship
Together we are one
A day we will never forget

And now everything is ready
So when the day is done

[Rainbow Dash]
The weather

[Applejack]
The banquet

[Rarity]
The style

[Fluttershy]
And music

[All]
All will be in perfect harmony!

Twilight Sparkle: [gasps, yells, groans]
[ponies gasping]
Twilight Sparkle: Pinkie!
[splat!]
Pinkie Pie: Oopsie! Guess my easy bake confetti cake cannon needs a little bit more fine tuning!
Twilight Sparkle: [nickers] Hmmm...
Code Red: Songbird Serenade? Is it really her? It is, it is!
Songbird Serenade: Hiya. I'm lookin' for the pony in charge?
[camera flashing]
Songbird Serenade: I need to set up for my sound check.
Twilight Sparkle: Ms. Songbird Serenade? Um, I was just 
going to check on you. [laughs nervously] I'm Princess Twilight, and 
sorry about the mess. I'm usually not so...
[ponies gasping]
Female pony: Oh! How embarrassing!
Songbird Serenade: Caked in cake?
Twilight Sparkle: Heh heh.
Vinny: You have visual on buttercream?
Whinnyfield: Visual confirmed. Go for cleanup.
[thunder]
Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] Storm clouds? I ordered perfect weather! Rainbow Dash?!
Rainbow Dash: Uh... I... don't think those are storm clouds.
[ominous music]
Pinkie Pie: Ooh! I bet those are the clowns I ordered!
[crumbling]
[balloons deflate]
Pinkie Pie: ...Or definitely not the clowns I ordered.
[balloon deflates]
[ponies gasp]
Party Favor: Brian, no!
Grubber: [breathing and grunting]
[microphone feedback]
Grubber: [clears throat, voice echoing] Ponieth of Equethtria, we come on behalf of the fearsome, the powerful, the almighty...Thtorm King!
[ponies cowering and whispering]
Female pony: This is terrible!
Grubber: And now, to deliver the evil, evil methage, put your hooveth together for Commander Tempeeeetht!
[sparking]
Twilight Sparkle: Is that a... unicorn?
Spike: I think so, but what happened to her horn?
Princess Celestia: "Tempest" is it? How may we help you?
Tempest Shadow: Oh, I'm so glad you asked. How about we start with your complete and total surrender?
Twilight Sparkle: Hi there. Princess of Friendship. Not exactly sure what's going on, but I know we can talk things out.
Tempest Shadow: Oh, goody. All four Princesses. Here's 
the deal, ladies. I need your magic. Give it up nicely, please, or we 
make it difficult for everyone!
Princess Luna: And why should we cower before you? There's one of you and hundreds of us.
Tempest Shadow: [chuckles] I was hoping you'd choose "difficult".
[storm creatures growl]
[airships hovering]
Twilight Sparkle: [gasps]
Princess Cadance: [gasps]
[storm creatures roar]
[ponies screaming]
Tempest Shadow: [grunts]
Princess Cadance: [grunts, screams]
Twilight Sparkle: [gasps]
Princess Celestia: Cadance!
Princess Cadance: [gasps] I can't... stop it!
Tempest Shadow: [grunts]
Princess Celestia: Luna, quick! Go south beyond the Badlands!
Princess Luna: Hmph!
Tempest Shadow: [grunts]
Princess Celestia: Seek help from the Queen of the Hippo— [screams]
Princess Luna: [gasps, grunts, yelps]
Twilight Sparkle: Luna!
Tempest Shadow: [chuckles]
Rainbow Dash: Twilight!
Tempest Shadow: [chuckles] Easy as pie.
Grubber: Oh, I love pie. Oh, you totally got the latht Printheth!
Tempest Shadow: That's not the Princess! Grubber, get her now!
Grubber: Guyth, we gotta get the Princess!
[clatter]
Applejack: Over here, y'all!
Twilight Sparkle: Come on!
Mane Six: [panting]
Twilight Sparkle: [grunts]
[bridge crumbles]
Mane Six: [scream]
[splash!]
Mane Six: [gasp for air, scream]
[music grows intense]
[music becomes quieter]
Grubber: Which one of you guyth ith goin' down there?
[storm creatures growl]
Grubber: [sighs] I would, but I jutht had a hearty meal, and I will think and I will thide-cramp. I'm very big-boned. I think quick.
[water flowing]
Rarity: [catching her breath]
Applejack: Everypony okay?
Rarity: I think my bottom's on backward.
Pinkie Pie: We just got our cupcakes handed to us by the worst party crasher ever!
Rainbow Dash: We gotta go back there and fight!
Spike: Well, you saw the size of those goons. You seriously wanna go back?
Applejack: So now what? We can't hide here forever. And let's be honest, we can't go back. Look at what they did to the Princesses. We gotta keep them from Twilight.
Twilight Sparkle: The Queen.
Pinkie Pie: Yeah, the Queen! Uh, what queen?
Twilight Sparkle: Celestia told Luna to find the Queen of the... "Hippos". Luna can't, so I have to.
Rainbow Dash: Uh, hippos? Seriously?
Pinkie Pie: I've heard they're surprisingly graceful for their size. Huh, but they're always hungry.
Spike: Hungry?
Applejack: Hippos?
Twilight Sparkle: They're somewhere south, past the Badlands.
Fluttershy: That means we'll have to... leave Equestria. Oh!
Rarity: I'm not even packed!
Twilight Sparkle: I understand you're scared, and nopony else has to go. But I have to find this queen. She might be our only hope.
[music]
Rainbow Dash: Well, you're not getting all the glory. We're in this together.
Applejack: We got your back.
Pinkie Pie: Indeedy!
Rarity: I am ready to save Equestria!
Fluttershy: Yay.
Spike: We're all behind you, Twilight.
Pinkie Pie: Let's go find this hippo!
Spike: Uh, south?
Pinkie Pie: Hehe! Whee! [giggles] Whee! Boingy-boingy-boingy-boingy-boingy! Anypony up for a game of "I Spy"?
All but Pinkie Pie: [groan]
Pinkie Pie: No, really! Come on! I spy with my little eye something that is orange. No takers? It's you, Applejack! [giggles]
[storm creatures grunting]
Tempest Shadow: All this power wasted on parties when there are far greater uses.
[ringtone]
Tempest Shadow: Well? Answer it!
[dial-up modem noises]
The Storm King: Where am I supposed to be looking? I never understand how this spell works. Tempest!
Tempest Shadow: Over here, Your Excellency.
The Storm King: Where?
Tempest Shadow: Over here.
The Storm King: Huh?
Tempest Shadow: No. No, right. Look right.
The Storm King: My right?
Tempest Shadow: Yep.
The Storm King: Oh. There you are. Here's the deal. I'm 
in the middle of a big re-brand here. "The Storm King" is tracking well 
as "intensely intimidating", but you know what? I need to back it up. 
You know what I need to back it up with? A storm! That would be 
great! You promised me magic that could control the elements, and right 
now, I'm holding a what? A branch. A twig. Bleh!
Tempest Shadow: Uh, that would be the Staff of Sacanas, Your Excellency, and it will...
The Storm King: Mm-hmm?
Tempest Shadow: ...channel the magic of the four rulers of this land.
The Storm King: Mm-hmmmm?
Tempest Shadow: You'll soon have the power of a hundred armies.
The Storm King: So that would be a yes on your locking down the four Pegacornicuseses, or whatever you call them?
Tempest Shadow: Give me three days. I'll have everything ready for your arrival.
The Storm King: [ominous] Remember, Tempest. Only I have
 the power to make you whole. Make this twig work, and you'll get your 
reward. Fail me, and your horn won't be the only thing that's broken.
Tempest Shadow: It won't be a problem.
The Storm King: [upbeat] Great! [warbling] I'm ready to power up, crash and bash, and be the biggest, baddest bugaloooooo...
[beat]
Grubber: Thorry, bad thpell thervice. You want me to call him back?
Tempest Shadow: Do you have the Princess?
Grubber: Well, uh, funny thtory. It kinda theemth like 
she... she might've like, you know, got away... a little bit. I know 
you're dithappointed, but I got one word for you: "thpongecake".
[zap]
Grubber: [screams]
Tempest Shadow: I need all four for the staff to work.
Grubber: Hey, I know! I want the Thtorm King to fix that crazy horn as badly as you do. It lookth like a crackly chipped tooth on the top of your head. And you know you don't look good in hatth.
Tempest Shadow: That Princess is not gonna keep me from getting my horn back! Prepare my ship!
Grubber: Ihhh!
Tempest Shadow: Please. How far could one little pony get on her own?
[slide guitar sting]
Pinkie Pie: [panting] There's sand in my... 
everything... Heh... Saving... Equestria... [demented laugh] Oh! Look! 
Maybe this guy knows which way to go! What's that, friend?  We're lost? 
[demented laugh, coughs, faints]
Rarity, Rainbow Dash and Spike: [panting]
Spike: We could be going in... circles! Endless... 
sand... [inhales] Nothin' for miles... but sand... [breathes] and this 
rock... [coughs] and this cactus... [breathes] and this 
roooooooooaaaaaad.... [breathes, faints, breathes] ...this rooooooad....
Twilight Sparkle: Hmm? A road? Where there's a road, there's a... [gasps]
Spike: Whoa!
Rainbow Dash: Cool!
Applejack: What is that?
Pinkie Pie: Oooh! A city! [scoffs] We are doing it, you guys! 
Rarity: You know what they say: where there's a city, there's a spa!
Rainbow Dash: Who says that?
Applejack: 'Case you forgot, we're on a mission to save Equestria.
Rarity: I can multitask.
[bird squawking]
Pig Creature 1: Don't worry, little one, we'll let ya go!
Pig Creature 2: To the highest bidder!
Pig Creatures: [laugh]
Pig Creature 1: Nice!
[birds squawking]
Vendor 1: Storm King bobbleheads!
Vendor 2: Ooh. Hey! You with the horn, you selling?
Fluttershy: Oh...
[birds squawking loudly]
Fluttershy: Ooh!
Twilight Sparkle: Hi there! Ooh, I'm sorry. Here. Lemme help you with that.
Pushkin: Hey! No magic around my merchandise!
Mane Six: [scream]
Capper: Hmmm... Very interesting...
Twilight Sparkle: Okay. We just gotta stick together. Be careful who you talk to. And try to blend in.
Pinkie Pie: Can I have your attention please?!
Twilight Sparkle: [groans]
Pinkie Pie: Can anypony take us to the Queen of the Hippos?!
Mori: You want something? You gotta give something!
Pinkie Pie: Well, how about a big warm hug from a grateful pony friend?
[honk]
Pinkie Pie: How about this comb that I've never used? A picture of my sister Maud? This breath mint? Seriously, buddy. Help me help you.
Pig Creature 1: [belches]
Twilight Sparkle: Pinkie, you can't just take off! [through clenched teeth] And you don't need to announce to every...
Pinkie Pie: Relax, Twilight! I totally got this!
Louise: How much for the giant gecko?
Mane Six: Huh?
Spike: Who you callin' a gecko?
Twilight Sparkle: Uh, Spike isn't for sale.
Vera: I want that fancy purple hair! I'll give ya two storm bucks for it!
Rarity: Two storm bucks?! It's worth more than that!
Twilight Sparkle: Heh?
[various creatures bidding]
Deer Creature: Gimme that pink one!
Pig Creature 1:  I'll take the blue one!
Pig Creature 2: No! I want the blue one!
Louise: I need that lizard!
Creature 1: I'll take that picture of your sister!
Deer Creature: I want all seven for my collection!
Capper: Back up, everyone! Back it up! Y'all in some 
serious danger! Now you didn't touch any of them, did you? Just look at 
all those colors! You think that's natural? They're infected with 
"pastelis coloritis".
[creatures gasping]
Applejack: Now, you listen here, fella, there ain't—
Capper: Don't worry, don't worry, as long as you're not covered in purple splotches, you'll be fine. Uh-oh.
Mori: [gasps] What do I do?!
Capper: Enjoy your last moments and don't touch anyone. Because parts will fall off.
Mori: [screams] Me parts!
Vera: [gasps]
Capper: Well, all right. [purrs]
Rainbow Dash: You are awesome!
Capper: Mm-hm.
Rarity: And quite charming. [giggles]
Spike: Huh!
Capper: Capper's the name. Charming's my game. So... to the Hippos, then?
Pinkie Pie: [laughs]
Twilight Sparkle: I don't know if we should trust him.
Pinkie Pie: We could definitely use a friend out here!
Capper: You know what? Little Cotton Candy Hair is right. And, if I do say so myself...
[Capper]
This town is not a nice place
For little fillies all alone
There are lots of twists and corners
That could lead to the unknown

Let me guide your way
And I'll be sure to help you through
You could really use a friend out here
And luckily for you...

I'm the friend that you need
When you're lost and don't know what to do
I'm your pal, your amigo
Useful and resourceful, too

And my help, you'll concede
Is a plus guaranteed
You can call and I'll come running
Just follow my lead
'Cause I'm the friend you need!

[Klugetown Wool-Seller]
He's a friend

Scaly Klugetowner: Quite a friend!
[Klugetowners]
He's a friend indeed!
[chomp]

[Capper]
You need a bud to spot the danger
A pal to stop the creep
A chum and not a stranger to assist

You need a bro who is cunning
That can help you take the leap
A friend who knows what's lying in the mist

Don't fear these darkened alleys
They're scary, yes, I know
Why, you could use a friend
To protect you wherever you go

And such a dazzling beauty
Covered in dirt and muck
But now your fate is changing
Now you are in luck

'Cause I'm the friend that you need
When you're lost and don't know what to do
I'm your pal, your amigo
Lookin' out for friends like you

And my help, you'll concede
Is a plus guaranteed
Just call and I'll come running
We'll say it's agreed...

[to Needy] Here. Tell Verko, "My place, twenty minutes." I've got something that will "magically" erase all my debt.
'Cause I'm the friend you need!

[Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, and Rainbow Dash]
He's a friend

Rarity: Quite a friend!
[Ponies except Twilight Sparkle]
He's a friend indeed!

Capper: Welcome, my little ponies, to my little manor.
Rarity: Ooh! A sort of a roco-hobo-Bohemian hodgepodge.
Capper: Apologies for the state of my litter box. I wasn't expecting guests.
Pinkie Pie: Ooh! So many fun breakables!
Rainbow Dash: Whoa!
Applejack: [chuckles]
Capper: Y'all sure y'all want the Hippos?
Pinkie Pie: Yessirree! The Queen of the Hippos!
Capper: Not like the Queen of the Lions, or Tigers, or Bears?
Fluttershy: Oh, my!
Twilight Sparkle: Huh?
[storm creature grunting]
Vera: [screaming]
Toothy Klugetowner: Please! Please! I don't know anything! [screams]
Grubber: You really think the ponieth got thith far?
Tempest Shadow: [sniffs] Oh, they're here. Attention! A little purple pony passed this way. Tell me where she is...
Grubber: ...or thumpin real bad'th gonna happen. [squeaks]
Mori: You think we're gonna fall for this again? I don't
 know what kinda scam you're workin' with Capper and the rest of your 
friends, but--
Tempest Shadow: "Friends?"
Mori: Poison or no poison, you're gonna pay!
Tempest Shadow: [grunts]
Mori: [groans]
Grubber: Ohhhh, Fishman juth got dropped!
Tempest Shadow: Now...
Mori: Ihhhh...
Tempest Shadow: ...about this... "Capper"...
[horn charges up]
["The Girl from Ipanema" playing]
[Mane Six and Capper laughing]
Capper: Stop playin' me! A sonic rainboom? That's not a real thang! Is that a real thing?
Rainbow Dash: I'll show ya!
Capper: Naw-naw-naw, I don't need you sonic "rainbooming" up in my place, thank you very much. Whoa, hey, hold up now. Whoa.
Rarity: Here you go. I do apologize. If we were back home, I could've done something truly fabulous.
Capper: Okay... What's the catch?
Rarity: Nothing. After all that you've done for us, consider it a "thank you".
Capper: Oh. Uh, don't thank me. Really.
Twilight Sparkle: Guys! We've been looking for the wrong queen! We don't need the Queen of the Hippos! We need the Queen of the Hippogriffs! Part pony, part eagle!
Capper: Oh! Oh, the Hippogriffs! Now, the trouble with that is... no one knows... where they are...
Twilight Sparkle: Says here they're on the top of Mount Aris!
Pinkie Pie: You mean the mountain right outside the window?
Capper: Objects in windows may be less mountainous than they appear. Heh heh heh...
Twilight Sparkle: Let's go, everypony.
Capper: [gasps] Wait! [cat yowl] You can't—you can't 
make it by y'allselves. You need an airship! And lucky for you, I can 
get you a ride.
Twilight Sparkle: I think we can get there on our own.
[door opens]
Verko: Here's Verko! [laughs]
Twilight Sparkle: [gasps]
Verko: These ponies better shoot rainbow lasers out 
their eyes if they're gonna settle your debt! Brought the big cage. 
Let's load 'em up!
Mane Six: [gasp]
Rarity: You were... You were going to sell us?
Twilight Sparkle: I knew it! We gotta get outta here!
Tempest Shadow: [chuckles evilly]
Twilight Sparkle: [gasps]
Tempest Shadow: Silly little ponies.
Twilight Sparkle: Tempest!
Spike: [screams]
Fluttershy: [squeaks]
Tempest Shadow: [resumes chuckling] Trusting strangers? Big mistake. Big...
Grubber: Huge!
Verko: Hoo-hoo! My goodness! Well, look at you! With your scary broken horn and scowly eyes. What tricks do you know, my little pony-wony?
[zap!]
Verko: [weakly] Not bad... [faints]
Twilight Sparkle: Go! Go!
Tempest Shadow: Get her now!
Grubber: You gonna be thcared now, ponieth!
Mane Six: [panting]
[storm creatures grunting]
Mane Six: [screaming and grunting]
[crash]
Mane Six: [screaming]
Applejack: I'm... gonna... be... sick!
Mane Six: [screaming and panting]
[crumbling]
Twilight Sparkle: We have to get there! To the docks! Hurry!
Rainbow Dash: [grunting]
Applejack: That's it.
Rarity: [yelps]
Applejack: Don't look down now!
Spike: [yells]
Pinkie Pie: Yay!
Spike: Dah!
Pinkie Pie: Woo! [screams]
Twilight Sparkle: Pinkie!
Pinkie Pie: [screams]
Twilight Sparkle: [pants, grunts]
Pinkie Pie: Best... escape... plan... ever!
Twilight Sparkle: WHAT?!?! Thwa!
Spike: Shh!
Boyle: Did you hear something?
Squabble: [squawks]
Boyle: Eh, probably just the rats. If we find 'em, we'll eat 'em.
Rarity: Rats?
[storm creatures growling]
Capper: [grunts]
Tempest Shadow: Now... where are they going?
[horn charges up]
Capper: Okay. No need for violence. Uh, they're headed...
[button sparkles]
[beat]
Capper: They headed east! Yeah, to... to Black Skull 
Island. So, uh, glad I could be of service to His Majesty, the Storm 
King. I'll just be on my way. [yowls]
Tempest Shadow: When I get my Princess. Until then, your fate is still... up in the air.
Grubber: [laughs] Oh, you're gonna go in the thkiff! Which ith a boat! Thpethifically, a air-boat! [laughs]
Capper: [yowls]
Grubber: We make a great team. I love it how you thaid hith fate wuth "up in the air", and then I thaid, "you're gonna be in the air on an air-boat!"
[ship horn blows]
[ship bell clangs]
Boyle: [belches and scratches]
Rainbow Dash: Blugh!
Applejack: Whadaya think, Twilight? Should we just... ask 'em to take us?
Twilight Sparkle: Last time we trusted somepony, he tried to sell us!
Mane Six: [gasp]
Boyle: Hey, guys! Come check this out!
Mullet: Looks like a pack of stowaways.
Lix Spittle: What are we s'posed to do with 'em?
Squabble: [squawks]
Boyle: I think we tie 'em up!
Applejack: [gasps]
Lix Spittle: [squawks] We clip their wings!
Rainbow Dash: [gasps]
Mullet: Nah. We scar 'em...
Rarity: [yelps]
Mullet: ...emotionally!
Fluttershy: [sobs]
Mullet: Wai-wai-wai-wait. What say the book, Captain Celaeno?
Captain Celaeno: Storm King's rule book says, "Throw them overboard."
Mane Six: Huh?
[parrots grunting]
[union whistle blows]
Captain Celaeno: All right! That's lunch!
[splut]
Twilight Sparkle: What?
[munching]
Rainbow Dash: Whoa whoa whoa! So you were about to toss us overboard and you stopped for a lunch break?
Boyle: Storm King only allows one break a day for meals, then it's back to hauling goods.
Spike: So you're delivery guys?
Captain Celaeno: And gals. These uniforms aren't exactly doing us any favors.
Twilight Sparkle: Then can you deliver us to Mount Aris?
Captain Celaeno: Sorry. We do what the Storm King orders or we suffer his wrath.
Twilight Sparkle: Right. Still going overboard.
Lix Spittle: Eh, it's nothing personal. Pudding?
Rarity: There's pudding?
[splut]
Rarity: Oh.
Rainbow Dash: You weren't always delivery birds, were you? What about before the Storm King?
Captain Celaeno: Yeah. We used to be much more adventurous. 
Pinkie Pie: Ooh! I met that guy in the desert!
Rainbow Dash: Whoa! You used to be pirates?!
Mullet: Um, we prefer the term "swashbuckling treasure hunters".
Rainbow Dash: So... pirates.
Squabble: [squawks]
Rainbow Dash: You birds have a choice to make. You could let some cloven-hoofed Storm King tell you how to live your lives, or...
[whoosh]
Rainbow Dash: ...you could be awesome again!
Twilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash, this really isn't a good time for a—
[Rainbow Dash]
I know the world can get you down

Twilight Sparkle: —song.
[Rainbow Dash]
Things don't work out quite the way that you thought
Feeling like all your best days are done
Your fears and doubts are all you've got

But there's a light shining deep inside
Beneath those fears and doubts, so just squash 'em
And let it shine for all the world to see
That it is time, yeah, time to be awesome

[Ponies]
Ah, ah, ah-ah, awesome!
It's time to be so awesome!
Ah, ah, ah-ah, awesome!
It's time to be so awesome!

[Captain Celaeno]
You've no idea how hard it's been

[Ponies]
(It's time to be awesome!)

[Captain Celaeno]
This dull routine we've been forced to do

[Rainbow Dash]
Don't let them rob you of who you are
Be awesome, it's all up to you

[Captain Celaeno]
I feel the light stirring deep inside
It's like a tale still yet to be told

[Ponies]
(It's time to be awesome!)

[Rainbow Dash and Captain Celaeno]
And now it's time to break the shackles free
And start living like the brave and the bold!

[All]
It's time to be awesome!
Let loose, be true, so awesome!
It's time to be awesome!
Go big, be you, so awesome!

[Mullet]
We used to soar through the clouds in the skies

[Lix Spittle]
Elaborate schemes we would love to devise

[Boyle]
 We rescued our treasure and stored it away

[Captain Celaeno]
Saving those gemstones for a rainy day

[All]
We see that light filling up our skies

[Rainbow Dash]
So take the Storm King's orders and toss 'em

[All]
'Cause it's the time to let our colors fly

[Captain Celaeno]
Hey, scallywags, it's time to be awesome!

[All]
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

[instrumental continues]
Captain Celaeno: Come on! Let's show these little ponies how it's done!
Mane Six except Twilight: [oohing and ahing]
Rainbow Dash: Awesome! I knew you had it in ya! And now for the finishing touch!
Pinkie Pie: Rainboom! Rainboom! Rainboom! Rainboom!
Twilight Sparkle: No no no no no! No!
[sonic rainboom]
Rainbow Dash: Aw, yeah! [laughs]
Captain Celaeno: Wow!
Twilight Sparkle: Ohhh!
Grubber: [slurping] Huh? Huh? Looka that rainbow! Looka that rainbow! Whoa, that'th so cool!
Tempest Shadow: Yeah. Of them to alert us. Funny, though. [to Capper] They don't seem to be heading to Black Skull Island.
Capper: Like "ha ha" funny or... ha ha...
Grubber: [yells]
[airship backfiring]
[swords clanging]
Captain Celaeno: Yeah! Ha ha!
Rainbow Dash: Nice!
Captain Celaeno: [laughs]
Squabble: [squawking]
[bell ringing]
Captain Celaeno: Storm guards! Looks like they found you!
Twilight Sparkle: Tempest!
Captain Celaeno: Secure the rigging! Lock down the cargo! Everyone, prepare to be boarded!
Fluttershy: Oh my goodness!
Rainbow Dash: Ya think she saw my sonic rainboom?
Twilight Sparkle: Are you kidding me?!?!
[thud!]
[pirates yelping]
Mane Six: [scream]
Spike: Whoa!
Grubber: [grunts]
[storm creatures grunt]
Grubber: [chomps]
Tempest Shadow: Where is the Pony Princess?
Captain Celaeno: "Princess"? Prin-Cess, Prin-Cess... Nope. All we're hauling is Storm King merchandise.
Squabble: [squawks]
Tempest Shadow: You do realize that if you were to shelter fugitives, the Storm King would be quite... explosive.
Captain Celaeno: [gulps]
Twilight Sparkle: [whispering loudly] We have to get off this ship before they tell Tempest we're here!
Rainbow Dash: [whispering loudly] We helped them get their mojo back! They're not gonna give us up!
Rarity: [breathes loudly]
Fluttershy: [shivers]
Applejack: [sighs]
Pinkie Pie: Whoa!
[crash!]
Twilight Sparkle: [sighs]
[woodwinds]
Twilight Sparkle: I've got this!
Tempest Shadow: Now, I'm gonna count to three, and if you don't tell me where they are, your ship is going down. One... 
Twilight Sparkle: Hold this!
Rainbow Dash: What are you doing?!
Tempest Shadow: ...two...
Grubber: Oh, thith is inteeenth!
Tempest Shadow: Three!
Pinkie Pie: [screams]
Tempest Shadow: What?
Captain Celaeno: [gasps]
Rarity: Oh, for Celestia's sake!!!
Pinkie Pie: [screams, laughs] Whee!
Fluttershy: [yells] I can't look!
Rarity: [screams] Ooh! [resumes screaming] Huh?
Fluttershy: Ooh!
Pinkie Pie: Whee!
Rainbow Dash: Huh?
Applejack: What in the hay is she up to?
[strings and brass building up]
Spike: [yelps] Huh? [breathes fire]
Mane Six: [cheering]
Pinkie Pie: Whee-hee-hee!
Mane Six: [sighing]
Rarity: Thank goodness.
Applejack: Phee-yew! Quick thinkin', Twilight!
Twilight Sparkle: Yahoo! Ha ha!
Pinkie Pie: That was fun! Can we do it again?
Rainbow Dash: Next stop, Mount Aris!
Twilight Sparkle: We're home free!
Mane Six: [cheering]
[storm creatures grunting]
Grubber: There'th no ponieth. But I found thith. It'th a... kind of a cupcake... with thprinkleth... Oh, yeah, and I found thith, too.
Tempest Shadow: Huh.
Grubber: Wow, this is a real artitht!
Tempest Shadow: Looks like they're heading to Mount Aris.
Capper: Really? [stammering and laughing nervously] Mou-
 Mount Aris? I... Well, that's my mis— I didn't know that... Mount 
Ari... My bad, I didn't... That's my... I'm sorry, I'm very very sorry.
Tempest Shadow: Now, about your betrayal...
[zap]
[fireworks]
[splashes]
[waves crashing]
Rarity: We had to crash the balloon at the bottom
 of the mountain! That's it! I simply... cannot... even! I have nothing!
 The bad guys have won! I'm so sorryyyyyyyy-y-y-y!
Rainbow Dash: We're almost there!
Rarity: [growls] Will you stop saying that?!
Rainbow Dash: No, really! We're actually here!
Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] This is it!
Pinkie Pie: Ooh!
Applejack: Well, I'll be. [laughs] Hippogriffs, here we come!
Rarity: [sighs] Time to rest my hooves!
[quiet strings and woodwinds]
Rarity: Are we sure this is the right place?
Applejack: Hello?! Is anypony home?!
Pinkie Pie: No Hippogriffies here! Or here! Or here! Or here or here or here! Waaaaaiiit! Nope! This place is emp-ty!
Twilight Sparkle: But... Celestia... The map. They have to be here.
Spike: Something bad happened here. Something that turned this whole place into a ghost town.
Fluttershy: A g-g-g-g-ghost town?!
[distant humming]
Fluttershy: [gasps]
Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] It's coming from over there!
[humming continues to grow louder]
[crumbles]
Princess Skystar: [gasps] What was that?!
[splash!]
Pinkie Pie: Hey! Wait up! Cannonball!
[splash!]
Twilight Sparkle: Pinkie!
Pinkie Pie: [sputters] She's gone!
[water flushing]
Twilight Sparkle: Now what?
[bubbles]
Pinkie Pie: Huh?
Mane Six: [scream]
Rarity: Oh, boy. I hate epic adventures.
Mane Six: [screaming, trying to talk]
Twilight Sparkle: [gasps for air]
Mane Six: [gasping for air]
Pinkie Pie: Way to leave it to the last minute, Twilight!
Twilight Sparkle: I didn't make these bubbles!
Fluttershy: Then [pants] who did?
[something swimming past]
Mane Six: [gasp]
Twilight Sparkle: Hello? We're looking for the Hippogriffs.
Princess Skystar: How do I know I can trust you?
Twilight Sparkle: Please. The Storm King invaded our land. And we need their help.
Princess Skystar: The Storm King?! I'm so glad I saved you guys! I'm totally taking you to my mom!
Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] Does your mother know where they are?
Princess Skystar: Oho! [singsongy] She might have an idea! [giggles]
Twilight Sparkle: Hoo-hoo!
[bubbles]
Princess Skystar: We're almost there!
[choir and orchestra playing]
Mane Six and Spike: Wow!
[choir and orchestra continue]
Princess Skystar: Mother, look what I found!
Queen Novo: Is it another shell?
Princess Skystar: Mm-mm.
Queen Novo: Because I am telling you if it is another 
shell, I am— [gasps loudly] Princess Skystar, whatta you done?! You know
 surface dwellers are forbidden here! Guards!
[guards grunting]
Mane Six: [gasp]
Princess Skystar: No no n-no! M-M-Mom, please! It is so not like that! The Storm King is trying to destroy their home, too!
Twilight Sparkle: We need to find the Hippogriffs. Do you know what happened to them?
Queen Novo: Well, of course I know. I'm the queen. I know everything.
Princess Skystar: Oh, oh, it's such a good story!
Queen Novo: Don't you dare tell them!
Princess Skystar: Once upon a time, like, a while ago, the Hippogriffs did live on Mount Aris.
Mane Six: Oooh!
Queen Novo: Did I not say don't tell them? But hey, I'm just the queen. Don't mind me.
Princess Skystar: Fine! I can't tell you! But if I could tell you, I'd say that that horned beast did show up to steal their magic!
Queen Novo: Seriously?
Princess Skystar: But, to keep it out of his clutches, 
their brave and majestic leader, Queen Novo, hid them deep underwater 
where he could never go! We are... Well, we were the Hippogriffs! Ta-da! [laughs] [whispering] But I totally did not tell you that!
Queen Novo: Well, I guess the pearl is out the oyster now. I am Queen Novo.
Applejack: Hold on now. Lemme get this straight. When the Storm King came, you just abandoned your entire city and fled?
Princess Skystar: We didn't flee! We swam! Y'know, in order to flee.
Twilight Sparkle: But... how?
Princess Skystar: Oh! Can we show them? Huh? These are 
the first guests we've had in, like, foreveeerrr! Can we, can we, can 
we, can we, can we, can we, can we, can we, can we?
Queen Novo: Well, I suppose I should make sure it still works. [chuckles]
Princess Skystar: [giggles]
Queen Novo: Careful, now.
Princess Skystar: [squeals]
Mane Six: Huh?
Twilight Sparkle: Oh! [laughs]
Fluttershy: Ooh! Oh! [laughs]
Applejack: Oh. Wa-wa-whoa! [laughs]
Mane Six: [awed reactions]
Fluttershy: Wow!
Rainbow Dash: [laughs]
Rarity: These fins are divine!
Rainbow Dash: Hey, Applejack, I'll race ya to that coral!
Applejack: You're on!
Pinkie Pie: Woo-hoo! [giggles] Ooh! Try it, Fluttershy!
Fluttershy: [giggles] Yay.
Spike: Guys? Guys? What is... [puffs] ...happening?!
Fluttershy: Aw, so cute!
Twilight Sparkle: This is amazing! With this, we could transform everypony at home into something powerful enough to face the Storm King's army!
Queen Novo: Or it could end up in his greedy claws!
Twilight Sparkle: But...
Queen Novo: Honey, I'm sorry about your home. I truly am. But my responsibility is to protect my subjects. The pearl... is not going anywhere.
Twilight Sparkle: But we've come all this way. And you can't just hide down here! Trapped forever! There's so much you're missing!
Queen Novo: We are one hundred percent okay with that!
Jamal: [chitters]
Queen Novo: Yes, Jamal?
Jamal: [chitters]
Queen Novo: Ooh! Time for my seaweed wrap.
Jamal: [chitters]
Queen Novo: Yes, a massage, too. Mama needs her deep tissue.
Applejack: So that's it? We left home for nothin'?
Princess Skystar: Oh, my gosh! Best... idea! You can 
stay with us! Forever! [laughs] There are so many things we can do! We 
can make friendship bracelets out of shells and... picture frames outta 
shells and... decorative wastebaskets out of shells... Oh, I have so 
many projects that involve shells, haha! Now I have someone new to share
 them with! I mean, aside from my friends, Shelly and Sheldon. Right? 
"Shelly"?
Pinkie Pie: [gasps]
Princess Skystar: And "Sheldon"? [chuckles] Get it? [chuckles, snorts]
Rarity: Ooh, ooh...
Pinkie Pie: [giggles]
Rarity: That sounds lovely, darling, but you must realize, we can't stay.
Applejack: We've gotta get back to our families.
Princess Skystar: Oh, no. Of course. Of course. Heh. Of 
course you have your own friends back home. It's fine. It's fine. Heh. 
[whispering] Shelly and Sheldon get jealous anyways. Heh. It's probably 
for the best. [sighs] Yeah, I'll just, um... [sadly] I'll get Mom to, 
uh, turn you back so you can go home.
Pinkie Pie: I know we have to go, but you guys saw how disappointed Princess Skystar was. Couldn't we stay for just a little longer?
Applejack: Pinkie, we just don't have time for—
Twilight Sparkle: Oh, no. No no. Pinkie's right.
Rainbow Dash: Say what now?
Twilight Sparkle: Well, we still need to come up with a 
plan to get back. A few minutes won't make a huge difference. And if 
there's anypony who can cram a lifetime of fun into a blink of an eye, 
it's Pinkie Pie!
Pinkie Pie: [squee]
Twilight Sparkle: So, go ahead and show Skystar the best time ever!
Pinkie Pie: I won't let you down!
Twilight Sparkle: I'm counting on it.
Rest of the Mane Six: [giggling]
[strings and harp]
Princess Skystar: [sniffling] It's probably for the best. [holding back tears]
[Pinkie Pie]
[as Shelly] Hey, now, don't be sad
[as Sheldon] I know we cannot stay
[normal voice] But we've got a couple minutes
And a little time to play

[Princess Skystar]
I know you have important things
So it's okay, just go

[Pinkie Pie]
But we can still pick one small, little thing
To do with you, y'know!

One small thing doesn't seem like a lot
One small thing, work with the time you've got
Soon, one small thing becomes two
After two, perhaps another few
Then one small thing is not so small
One small thing can be the biggest thing of all

[Princess Skystar]
All right now, since you're here
Let's see what we can do
Swim with the flow until you go
Together, me and you

[Pinkie Pie]
I've got necklaces for everyfish
So what else do ya got?

[Princess Skystar]
Well, we could play the bubblefish
You'll like this one a lot!

[Pinkie Pie and Princess Skystar]
One small thing, it's a good place to start

[Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Fluttershy]
(Just one small thing)

[Pinkie Pie and Princess Skystar]
One small thing, and we don't seem so far apart

[Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Fluttershy]
(Don't seem apart)

[All]
Soon, one small thing leads to more
It's so much more than there was before
Just one small thing, and you will see
The start of something big for you and me

[Pinkie Pie]
One small thing

[Seaponies]
Just one small thing

[Princess Skystar]
Or a tall thing

[Seaponies]
Just one tall thing

[Fluttershy]
Or a sing thing

[Seaponies]
Just one sing-y thing

[Rarity]
Or a bling thing

[All]
Just one bling-y thing

[Applejack]
A conga thing

[All]
Yeah, a conga thing

[Rainbow Dash]
Or a longah thing

[Seaponies]
Just one longah thing

[Pinkie Pie]
A blue thing, true thing, you thing

[Seaponies]
(Oooh-oooh)

[Princess Skystar]
A whee thing, sea thing, me thing

[Seaponies]
(Oooh-oooh-oooh!)

[Pinkie Pie and Princess Skystar]
So many things and everything until our time is done
There's one small thing for each and everyone!

[Princess Skystar]
One small thing, so much we can create
You and me, we started something great
It's so amazing, look around
At all the happy sights and sounds
One small thing is big, it's true
You did this all for us
I just wish there was one small thing
An extra special kind of thing

[Princess Skystar and Seaponies]
That we could do for you...
One small thing!

Queen Novo: Woo! [laughs]
Princess Skystar: Hmm?
Pinkie Pie: [giggles]
Rest of the Mane Six: [laugh]
Queen Novo: Well, I guess there is one small thing we can do.
Pinkie Pie: Ahhh!
[alarm blaring]
Rest of the Mane Six: [gasp]
Female seapony: The pearl alarm! Oh, no, the pearl alarm!
Princess Skystar: [gasps]
Twilight Sparkle: [yelling in distance]
[alarm continues]
Twilight Sparkle: [struggling] Ow!
Queen Novo: [snarls]
Twilight Sparkle: No! Please!
Queen Novo: All of this so you could sneak in and take the pearl?!
Princess Skystar: [yelps]
Queen Novo: [to Skystar] This is why we don't bring strangers into our home! [to Twilight, ominously] You don't deserve to be one of us.
[water]
[splashing]
Mane Six: [gasping for air]
Rainbow Dash: [coughing]
Rarity: [gasping, faints]
Applejack: What were you thinkin'? I mean, stealin' their pearl?
Twilight Sparkle: [sighs] It was the only way to save Equestria.
Pinkie Pie: 'Cept it wasn't! The Queen was going to say 
yes! We did what you told us and that's what made her realize we were 
ponies worth saving! [gasps] Unless... You didn't really want us to show her the best time ever! You just wanted us to distract her!
Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Rarity and Fluttershy: [gasp]
Twilight Sparkle: I never would have done it, but
 this isn't Equestria! We can't just dance around with con artists, make
 rainbooms in the sky and expect everything to work out! It's not 
enough! We are not enough!
Pinkie Pie: No, Twilight! We stuck together! We were gonna get the help we needed! The only thing that stopped us... was you!
Twilight Sparkle: Well, I'm doing the best I can!  It's all on me. I'm the one Tempest wants. I'm the last Princess!
Pinkie Pie: You're also the only one who doesn't trust her friends!
Twilight Sparkle: Well, maybe, I would've been better off without friends like you!!!
Pinkie Pie: [gasps]
[soft strings]
Fluttershy: [whimpers]
Twilight Sparkle: Pinkie, I...
Pinkie Pie: [sniffles] I just can't talk to you right now.
[strings continue]
[waves crashing]
[piano]
Spike: Twilight? It's okay. You'll figure it out.
Twilight Sparkle: [through tears] No. I can't. I ruined everything. There's no chance to save Equestria now. It's all my fault. Spike? [gasps]
Spike: [muffled] Twilight, look out!
Twilight Sparkle: [screams, gasps] No no no no no! Noooooo!
Spike: [muffled] Twilight, help me!
Twilight Sparkle: Spiiiiiike!!!
Spike: Twiliiiiiight!!!
Twilight Sparkle: [struggles]
[magic zap]
Twilight Sparkle: [grunting]
[magic zap]
Twilight Sparkle: [gasps]
Tempest Shadow: Aww, the "Princess of Friendship". With no friends! [chuckles] And no way out.
Twilight Sparkle: Why are you doing this? You're a pony! Just like me.
[zap]
Twilight Sparkle: [yelps]
Tempest Shadow: I'm nothing like you! I'm more than you'll ever be!
[Tempest Shadow]
It's time you learned a lesson
It's time that you understand
Don't ever count on anybody else
In this or any other land

I once hoped for friendship
To find a place among my kind
But those were the childish wishes
Of someone who was blind

Open up your eyes
See the world from where I stand
Me, among the mighty
You, caged at my command

Open up your eyes
Give up your sweet fantasy land
It's time to grow up and get wise
Come now, little one, open up your eyes

We all start out the same
With simple naive trust
Shielded from the many ways
That life's not fair or just

But then there comes a moment
A simple truth that you must face
If you depend on others
You'll never find your place

[instrumental]

And as you take that first step
Upon a path that's all your own
You see it all so clearly
The best way to survive is all alone

Open up your eyes
See the world from where I stand
Me, among the mighty
You, caged at my command

Open up your eyes
And behold the faded light
It's time to grow up and get wise
Come now, little one, open up your eyes

Open up your eyes!

Twilight Sparkle: I'm so sorry you felt so alone.
Tempest Shadow: I saw the truth. My "friends" abandoned 
me when times got tough. Looks like I'm not the only one. Face it, 
Princess. Friendship has failed you, too.
Twilight Sparkle: Friendship didn't fail me. I failed friendship.
[silence]
Fluttershy: [sighs] This whole journey was such a mistake. [gasps] All we wanted was somepony to help us.
Applejack: [sighs] Ya think, maybe it's time we talk to Twilight?
Spike: She's! Been! Taken!!!
Rainbow Dash: What?!
Spike: [panting] Twilight's been taken! Tempest! She grabbed her! And took her on her ship!
Rest of the Mane Six: [gasp]
Rainbow Dash: We gotta get her back!
Fluttershy: How? We'll never catch up!
Applejack: And we got no way to defeat those monsters.
Fluttershy: [sighs]
Capper: Well, good thing I happen to know of a group of mighty heroes that could handle this easily!
Rarity: [angrily] Well! Look what the cat dragged in! Himself!
Capper: These heroes have faced the Storm King's army 
and escaped! I've seen them tackle the streets of the roughest towns, 
break out of the tightest situations, and inspire others to join their 
cause!
Rest of the Mane Six and Spike: Ooooh.
Applejack: Now don't get too excited. He's just talkin' about us.
Rest of the Mane Six and Spike: Awww.
Capper: They even escaped certain doom at the hooves of Commander Tempest!
Rainbow Dash: Yeah. That was pretty great.
Captain Celaeno: Are you kidding me?! That was awesome!
Squabble: [squawks]
Boyle: Figured you could use a claw!
Captain Celaeno: We're on board to help you fight the Storm King! Just not on board our... actual ship.
Mullet: That crazy unicorn sunk it. But you got back our argh! And we're ready to kick some booty.
Boyle and other pirates: [laugh heartily]
[bubbles]
Rest of the Mane Six: [gasp]
Spike: Whoa!
[magic sounds]
Capper: Is that what I think it is?
Princess Skystar: Hellooooooo!! Me again! [giggles] I'm 
gonna get so grounded, but I talked things over with Shelly and Sheldon 
and they pointed out that you were just trying to help your friends.
Pinkie Pie: Ahhhh!
Princess Skystar: So I wanna help too. 'Cause ya know... one small thing... [whispering] can make a really big difference!
Spike: That's it, right? We didn't make friends with anypony else?
Capper: All right, y'all! I think our course is clear. Y'all ready to do this thang?
Pinkie Pie: We're coming, Twilight!
Everypony: [cheers]
Pinkie Pie: As soon as we bake up a plan!
[wind rustling]
[Songbird Serenade]
I am here and I see your pain
Through the storms, through the clouds, the rain
I'm telling you you can not escape

[storm creature growls, bangs on cage]
Songbird Serenade: [sighs]
[wheels clanking]
[doors open]
[music]
[clang]
[doors close]
Grubber: [laughs]
Twilight Sparkle: Tempest, don't do this. Don't give the Storm King—
Tempest Shadow: Your magic? Did you think you'd keep it 
all to yourself? Time to share. I'd love for everybody out there to know
 what I can really do.
The Storm King: Ooh, fascinating!  What can you really do?
Grubber: Your bidding, of courth, Your Mighty One.
[beat]
The Storm King: Bidding's good. I like bidding! Um, what are you supposed to be?
Twilight Sparkle: I'm the Princess of Friendship!
The Storm King: [laughs] Oh. That's nice. [to Tempest] Why is this one still moving?
Tempest Shadow: She and her friends put up a bit of a fight, but she's alone now. She won't be a problem.
The Storm King: Yeah. So, speaking of problems, this place, it seems a little too—oh, I don't know—cute!!!
 I don't like cute! I never did like cute! Doesn't really go with my 
whole "big bad powerful magic guy" thing, does it?! Deliver the 
punchline, Tempest, because this has gotta be a joke! [grunts]
[magic sounds]
The Storm King: Huh? [gasps]
[magic sounds]
Twilight Sparkle: [struggling] No!
The Storm King: [laughs] Check out the light show! Wow! Wow!
Twilight Sparkle: [gasps]
The Storm King: Let's get this storm started! Ooh, hey, that's good. I should trademark that.
[zap!]
Twilight Sparkle: [yelps]
The Storm King: Not bad. Actually, kinda first rate. What else does it do?
Tempest Shadow: Your Excellency, you promised to restore my horn and give me—
The Storm King: Deh-deh-deh-deh-deh, okay. Hang on.
[magic sounds]

[Songbird Serenade]
I know you, you're a special one
Some see crazy where I see love
You fall so low but shoot so high
Big dreamers shoot for open sky

So much life in those open eyes
So much depth, you look for the light

Capper: Ooh!
Rarity: And perfection!
[Songbird Serenade]
But when your wounds open, you will cry

Princess Skystar and Pinkie Pie: [laugh]
Princess Skystar: [gasps] Mom!
Queen Novo: You are so grounded! [laughs]
[Songbird Serenade]
You'll cry out now and you'll question why

I can see a rainbow
In your tears as they fall on down
I can see your soul grow
Through the pain as they hit the ground
I can see a rainbow
In your tears as the sun comes out
As the sun comes out

[instrumental]

Tempest Shadow: Well, that's one thing that never changes around here. The party.
Twilight Sparkle: Well, I hope you'll stay. More friends are definitely merrier.
Tempest Shadow: [sighs] But, um... my horn.
Twilight Sparkle: You know, your horn is pretty powerful, just like the pony it belongs to.
Tempest Shadow: I did tell you I wanted to show everypony in Equestria what I could do, right?
[zap]
[fireworks]
[Songbird Serenade]
I can see a rainbow
In your tears as they fall on down
I can see your soul grow
Through the pain as they hit the ground

Pinkie Pie: Oooh! What is it?!
Tempest Shadow: [quietly] It's "Fizzlepop Berrytwist".
Pinkie Pie: [gasps] Okay! That is the most awesome name ever!
[end credits]
[Songbird Serenade]
I can see a rainbow
In your tears as they fall on down
I can see your soul grow
Through the pain as they hit the ground
I can see a rainbow
In your tears as the sun comes out
As the sun comes out

I am here and I see your pain
Through the storms, through the clouds, the rain
I'm telling you you can not escape
You can do it, just feel, baby

I can see a rainbow
In your tears as they fall on down
I can see your soul grow
Through the pain as they hit the ground
I can see a rainbow
In your tears as they fall on down
I can see your soul grow
Through the pain as they hit the ground
In your tears as the sun comes out
As the sun comes out

Here comes the sun smiling down
Here comes the sun smiling down
Here comes the sun smiling down
Smiling down

I can see a rainbow
In your tears as they fall on down
I can see your soul grow
Through the pain as they hit the ground
I can see a rainbow
In your—
As the sun comes out

[Lukas Graham]
So, we wanna stay
But can't find peace while sittin' still
I guess we never will
We're on the way
We won't hurry back again
The journey is the end (oh)

I love this very moment
We're speedin' up, not slowin'
We might know we can't win
But we're dumb enough to try
We're going, there's no maybe
That's why they call us crazy
And we'll say if anybody asks us

"Hey (hey!), where you gonna go?" [clap clap]
We're off to see the world
We don't need to know (oh)
"Hey (hey!), where you gonna go?" [clap clap]
We're off to see the world
We don't need to know

We never need to know
Seekin' boundaries to break
Let's forget the ones we've made
So we carry on
Don't let good things pass us by
The time we're gone will be the best time of our life

I love this very moment
We're speedin' up, not slowin'
We might know we can't win
But we're dumb enough to try
We're going, there's no maybe
That's why they call us crazy
And we'll say if anybody asks us

"Hey (hey!), where you gonna go?" [clap clap]
We're off to see the world
We don't need to know (oh)
"Hey (hey!), where you gonna go?" [clap clap]
We're off to see the world
We don't need to know

So go tell 'em we won't stop
We know they can't change us
We're gonna go way off the map
To get ourselves back on the track

Go tell 'em we won't stop
We know they can't change us
No need to worry so much
We do whatever we want (oh)

"Hey (hey!), where you gonna go?" [clap clap]
We're off to see the world
We don't need to know (oh)
"Hey (hey!), where you gonna go?" [clap clap]
We're off to see the world
We don't need to know (oh)

Ohhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ohhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ohhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ohhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
